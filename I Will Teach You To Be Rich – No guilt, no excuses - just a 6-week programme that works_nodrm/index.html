      <p class="cotx"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he process of writing this book repeatedly made me wish I were dead. But once I was done, I felt great, my posture improved,
         my eyesight got clearer, and the world seemed great. I imagine this is what giving birth feels like.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I was fortunate to have a great team of people who helped me turn this book into its final form.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Jeff Kuo is simply the finest researcher I’ve ever worked with. He was instrumental in helping bring this book together.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m grateful to Chris Yeh, who’s not only a brilliant marketer but perhaps the most frugal man I have ever met. And to Ben
         Casnocha, a deep thinker who forced me to dig deeper into everything I wrote.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Noah Kagan and Charlie Hoehn helped me spread the word about this book. Couldn’t have done it without them.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Several friends helped immensely by reviewing drafts of this book, including Ben Abadi, Julie Nguyen, Vivek Sankaran, and
         Jen Tsang.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The folks at Workman were amazing: Margot Herrera, my editor, was incredibly skilled at helping me organize my thoughts into
         a coherent book. Plus, she’s fun: In one of the first chapters, I wrote an over-the-top joke just to see how fast she’d cut
         it. She just said, “I think we should keep it. It’s pretty funny.” What more could I ask for? Cassie Murdoch, the perfect
         complement to Margot, is ultra-organized and constantly thinking two steps ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Many thanks to Peter Workman, who is brilliant and eccentric&mdash;exactly as rumored&mdash;and to all the people who helped tell the
         world about this book: Andrea Bussell, Kristin Matthews, David Schiller, Andrea Fleck, and Justin Nisbet. Kudos to Janet Parker,
         Beth Levy, Barbara Peragine, Doug Wolff, David Matt, and Nora Krug.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Lisa DiMona has now worked with me on two books. You couldn’t ask for a better agent.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Seth Godin, who took a chance on a college kid with a cocky attitude and a lot of ambition, got me started in publishing.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">BJ Fogg, my mentor and professor, first showed me that you can use psychology for pro-social uses, not just to get people
         to buy more stuff.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To my family, Prab and Neelam Sethi, Nagina, Ibrahim, Rachi, Haj, and Maneesh&mdash;thanks for keeping me motivated for the last
         two years of writing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, to my readers. I hope this book helps you on your way to being rich.</p>

<div id="calibre_link-73" class="calibre">
      <p class="fmh1"><a href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre4"><strong class="calibre5">Foreword</strong></a></p>
      <p class="cotx">To my UK readers,</p>
      <p class="cotx">Let’s be honest. “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” sounds like a big fat scam. But it’s not&mdash;so where did the name come from?</p>
      <p class="calibre6">When I was in high school, coming from a middle-class family with four kids, my parents told me that if I wanted to go to
         college (which I had to, because I’m Indian), I’d have to get scholarships. Because I’m a big weirdo, I applied to over 70
         scholarships. I still remember my first one: They wrote the $2,000 check to me, which I promptly invested, losing 50% of it
         right away.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">After that, I decided to learn about money so I didn’t lose the rest. I read the books and magazines, watched the TV shows,
         and realized there are a few simple steps to getting rich&mdash;and a lot of hype.
      </p>
      <p class="bl">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room.</em></p>
      <p class="bl">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">It’s OK to make mistakes.</em></p>
      <p class="bl">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Read a lot so you know when to call BS, but not too much&mdash;action is more important than reading.</em></p>
      <p class="bl">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Ordinary actions get ordinary results.</em></p>
      <p class="bl1">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">And there’s a difference between being sexy and being rich.</em></p>
      <p class="p">As my website grew, I knew that young people were looking for this kind of information. It’s so easy to get overwhelmed, take
         the lazy road, and do nothing. That’s why I decided to teach people that getting rich can be easy, if you’re willing to put
         in a small amount of effort. But let’s be clear: If you expect to get rich quick, go find another book. In fact, what does
         “rich” mean to you? Is it about buying £200 shoes? Or the latest Mac? Or travelling?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Unlike other personal-finance pundits, you won’t find me wagging my finger, telling you to save on everything and count the
         number of grains of rice you can eliminate when cooking. Get a life. I <em class="calibre2">encourage</em> you to spend extravagantly on the things you love&mdash;if you can cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t. And perhaps earn
         a little extra money on the side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When I was approached with the idea of turning my website into a book, I jumped at the opportunity. But instead of just turning
         the existing posts into a book, I spent two years of pure hell rewriting everything and putting my recommendations in a six-week
         program. I wanted this book to be <em class="calibre2">the</em> book you use to get started with your money, optimise it, and become expert enough to dominate.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">A few weeks after the US edition of this book came out in March 2009, I flew to New York for a media tour. Just a few days
         later, my publishers took me out to a fancy dinner to celebrate the book launch. With about ten of the most senior people
         from the publishing house there, one of them made an announcement: “Ramit,” she said, “we’re thrilled to tell you that we’ve
         sold the UK rights for <em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</em>!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">What a great feeling&mdash;I had no idea they’d been working on this, and we were all clapping at the terrific news. But then I
         asked a question: “Who’s going to make sure everything is correct for the UK?” All of a sudden, the table got quiet. Selling
         an international edition is great, but nobody wants to be responsible for rewriting the book. Everyone at the table shrugged.
         I stared into the distance, deciding whether I should kill myself before or after dessert. I’d just spent two years writing
         the US edition and couldn’t bear the thought of starting all over again and learning how finances work in another country.
         Would you want to?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I shouldn’t have worried! Hodder &amp; Stoughton put together a great team to help me with all the changes that were needed for
         the UK. My editor Lisa Highton had so much enthusiasm and assured me I could rest easy in her hands. Heather Rainbow helped
         me translate American financial terms into UK terms to make sure everything made sense, and Independent Financial Advisor
         Sarah Pennells took a look at the financial specifics, so I’d know I was offering the right advice for the UK.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">However, there are a few things you need to know about to get the most out of my advice. I figured I should talk to you in
         the language of British Pounds Sterling, but whenever I refer to myself, or a friend over here, I’ve kept the dollar references
         because it doesn’t make any sense to translate that. The principles in getting rich are the same no matter if you use $ or
         £. There were other things that got translated too:
      </p>
      <p class="ul">“college/school” became “university”</p>
      <p class="ul1">“checking account” became “current account”</p>
      <p class="ul1">“mutual fund” became “actively managed fund”</p>
      <p class="ul1">“index fund” became “tracker fund”</p>
      <p class="ul2">and “popsicle” became “ice lolly” (this cracked me up)</p>
      <p class="p">However, this isn’t to say I’ve changed everything. I’m afraid you’ll have to put up with my American spelling! I’ve changed
         things where necessary and most important, but I’ve kept the core the same. There are some instances, however, where I couldn’t
         change specific examples so I want to give you a heads up on a few American terms that you’ll come across:
      </p>
      <p class="ul">401(k) = a retirement account set up by the company you work for</p>
      <p class="ul1">IRA = Individual Retirement Account</p>
      <p class="ul2">Roth IRA / Roth 401(k) = the same thing, but with tax incentives</p>
      <p class="p">Basically, they are all different kinds of pensions. As I’ve said, it’s the principles that matter, not the terms, so don’t
         worry if you don’t know the ins and outs of it all! When it comes to specifics, I’ve got lots of information and advice about
         UK pensions as well as ISAs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Lots of people like to believe that personal finance is rational and we always make the best decisions for our personal situations.
         That’s complete nonsense. We’re profoundly influenced by culture, psychology, and personal biases.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s why it’s important to acknowledge that young people in the UK are generally more wary of investing than young people
         in the US. The US stock market has, historically, given higher returns than the UK market does. Perhaps this is why Americans
         are more ready to risk some cash. But lower returns shouldn’t put you off&mdash;investing is still a great way to get earning more
         money and you’ll still be earning much more than you would with only a savings account. In fact, this should just encourage
         you to get investing sooner. Start investing today so you can earn far more than your friends and completely crush them over
         the long term, silently gloating all the while. I’ll show you how.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I know student debt is an increasing worry for young Brits, especially as fees keep rising. It can feel unaffordable, but
         education is important&mdash;even with the added debt, it will help you increase your wealth. I’ve included specific recommendations
         for paying off student debt in the UK.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">By going through this 6-week program, you’ll be able to identify the best accounts, figure out what to do with your money,
         set up a spending plan that doesn’t nag you for buying the things you love, and automatically invest for the future. Nobody
         wants to be a personal-finance expert&mdash;we just want to control our money to ensure it’s doing the right thing so that we can
         get on with our lives. Being rich isn’t just about how much money we have&mdash;but having more money helps.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m thrilled to pass along the system that has helped thousands of people in the US focus on living a rich life. Please let me know how this works for you.</p>

      <p class="cotx"><span class="dropcap">I</span>’ve always wondered why so many people get fat after college. I’m not talking about people with medical disorders, but regular
         people who were slim in college and vowed that they would “never, ever” get fat. Five years later, they look like the Stay
         Puft Marshmallow Man after a Thanksgiving feast, featuring a blue whale for dessert.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Weight gain doesn’t happen overnight. If it did, it would be easy for us to see it coming&mdash;and to take steps to avoid it. Ounce
         by ounce, it creeps up on us as we’re driving to work and then sitting behind a computer for eight to ten hours a day. It
         happens when we move into the real world from a college campus populated by bicyclists, runners, and varsity athletes who
         once inspired us to keep fit (or guilted us into it). When we did the walk of shame back at school, at least we were getting
         exercise. But try talking about post-college weight loss with your friends and see if they ever say one of these things:
      </p>
      <p class="ul"><em class="calibre2">“Avoid carbs!”</em></p>
      <p class="ul1"><em class="calibre2">“Don’t eat before you go to bed, because fat doesn’t burn efficiently when you’re sleeping.”</em></p>
      <p class="ul1"><em class="calibre2">“If you eat mostly protein, you can lose lots of weight quickly.”</em></p>
      <p class="ul2"><em class="calibre2">“Eating grapefruit in the morning speeds up your metabolism.”</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">I always laugh when I hear these things. Maybe they’re correct, or maybe they’re not, but that’s not really the point.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">The point is that we love to debate minutiae.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">When it comes to weight loss, 99.99 percent of us need to know only two things: Eat less and exercise more. Only elite athletes
         need to do more. But instead of accepting these simple truths and acting on them, we discuss trans fats, diet pills, and Atkins
         versus South Beach.

      <p class="calibre6">Most of us fall into one of two camps in regard to our money: We either ignore it and feel guilty, or we obsess over financial
         details by arguing interest rates and geopolitical risks without taking action. Both options yield the same results&mdash;none.
         The truth is that the vast majority of young people don’t need a financial adviser to help them get rich. We need to set up
         accounts at a reliable no-fee bank and then automate savings and bill payment. We need to know about a few things to invest
         in, and then we need to let our money grow for thirty years. But that’s not sexy, is it? Instead, we watch shows with talking
         heads who make endless predictions about the economy and “this year’s hottest stock” without ever being held accountable for
         their picks (which are wrong more than 50 percent of the time). Sometimes they throw chairs, which drives up ratings but not
         much else. And we look to these so-called “experts” more than ever in turbulent times like the global crisis of 2008. “It’s
         going up!” “No, down.” As long as there is <em class="calibre2">something</em> being said, we’re drawn to it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Why? Because we love to debate minutiae.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">When we do, we somehow feel satisfied. We might just be spinning our wheels and failing to change anyone’s mind, but we feel
         as if we are really expressing ourselves, and it’s a good feeling. We feel like we’re getting somewhere. The problem is that
         this feeling is totally illusory. Focusing on these details is the easiest way to get nothing done. Imagine the last time
         you and your friend talked about finances or fitness. Did you go for a run afterward? Did you send money to your savings account?
         Of course not.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">People love to argue minor points, partially because they feel it absolves them from actually having to do anything. You know
         what? Let the fools debate the details. I decided to learn about money by taking small steps to manage my own spending. Just
         as you don’t have to be a certified nutritionist to lose weight or an automotive engineer to drive a car, you don’t have to
         know everything about personal finance to be rich. I’ll repeat myself: <em class="calibre2">You don’t have to be an expert to get rich.</em> You <em class="calibre2">do</em> have to know how to cut through all the information and <em class="calibre2">get started</em>&mdash;which, incidentally, also helps reduce the guilt.
      </p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">It’s the first time since graduating a year ago that I’m earning enough to start paying back my student loan, so joining the
            company pension and saving for retirement was the last thing on my mind. However, when I noticed that my company would invest
            5% for my 3%, I realised opting out would be throwing money away, and as Ramit says, it’s better to start early. Because it
            comes out before I even see the money, I don’t miss what I never had, so I can keep dreaming about cruising the world as soon
            as I retire.</em></p>

      <h1 class="calibre11">Why Is Managing Money So Hard?</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eople have lots and lots of reasons for not managing their money, some of them valid but most of them poorly veiled excuses
         for laziness. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Let’s look at a few:
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">INFO GLUT</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">The idea that&mdash;gasp!&mdash;there is too much information is a real and valid concern. “But Ramit,” you might say, “that flies in
         the face of all American culture! We need more information so we can make better decisions! People on TV say this all the
         time, so it must be true! Huzzah!” Sorry, nope. Look at the actual data and you’ll see that an abundance of information can
         lead to decision paralysis, a fancy way of saying that with too much information, we do nothing. Barry Schwartz writes about
         this in <em class="calibre2">The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less:</em></p>
      <p class="ext"><em class="calibre2">… As the number of investment funds in a pension plan offered to employees goes up, the likelihood that they will choose a
            fund&mdash;any fund&mdash;goes down. For every 10 funds added to the array of options, the rate of participation drops 2 percent. And
            for those who do invest, added fund options increase the chances that employees will invest in ultraconservative money-market
            funds.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">You read the papers and see ads about shares, pensions, ISAs, insurance, child trust funds, and international investing. Where
         do you start? Are you already too late? What do you do? Too often, the answer is nothing&mdash;and doing nothing is the worst choice
         you can make, especially in your twenties. As the table on the next page shows, investing early is the best thing you can
         do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Look carefully at that chart. Smart Sally actually invests less, but ends up with about £15,000 more. She invests £100/month
         from age twenty-five to age thirty-five and then never touches that money again. Dumb Dan is too preoccupied to worry about
         money until he’s thirty-five, at which point he starts investing £100/month until he’s sixty-five. In other words, Smart Sally
         invests for ten years and Dumb Dan for thirty years&mdash;but Smart Sally has much more money. And that’s just with £100/month!
         The single most important thing you can do to be rich is to start early.

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE MEDIA IS PARTIALLY TO BLAME (I LOVE CASTING BLAME)</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Why does just about everything written about personal finance make me want to paint myself with honey and jump into a nest
         of fire ants? Personal-finance advice has been geared toward old white men and taught by old white men for far too long. I
         don’t understand why newspaper columnists continue to write about tax-optimization strategies and spending less on lattes,
         hoping that young people will listen. We don’t care about that. We care about knowing where our money’s going and redirecting
         it to go where we <em class="calibre2">want</em> it to go. We want our money to grow automatically, in accounts that don’t nickel-and-dime us with fees. And we don’t want
         to have to become financial experts to get rich.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Now, I fully recognize that I’m a big fancy author (that’s right, ladies) and am therefore part of the “media.” Perhaps it’s
         uncouth to mock my brethren. Still, I can’t help myself. Pick up any major magazine and chances are you’ll see an article
         called “10 No-Hassle Tips for Getting Ahead with Your Finances.” Amusingly, the same writers who breathlessly encouraged us
         to buy real estate in 2007 are now advising us on “what to do in the downturn.” I’m sick and tired of the same old boring,
         tired, and frankly horrible financial opinions that are paraded around as “advice.” More on this in <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">OTHER PEOPLE WE CAN BLAME FOR OUR MONEY PROBLEMS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">There are other common excuses for why we don’t manage our money. Most of them are complete B.S.:</p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our education system doesn’t teach this,” people whine. It’s easy for people in their twenties to wish that their colleges
         had offered some personal-finance training. Guess what? Most colleges <em class="calibre2">do</em> offer those classes. You just didn’t attend!
      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;I also often hear the cry that “credit-card companies and banks are out to profit off us.” Yes, they are. So stop complaining
         and learn how to game the companies instead of letting them game you.
      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m afraid of losing money,” some of my friends say. That’s fair, especially after market losses during the global financial
         crisis, but you need to take a long-term view. Also, you can choose among many different investment options&mdash;some aggressive,
         some conservative&mdash; it depends on how much risk you’re willing to take. (Because of inflation, you’re actually losing money
         every day your money is sitting in a bank account.) Fear is no excuse to do nothing with your money. When others are scared,
         there are bargains to be found.
      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;“What if I don’t know where to get an extra £100 per month?” It doesn’t have to be £100. And you don’t need to earn another
         penny. I’ll show you how to streamline your existing spending to generate that money to invest. Remember, £1 saved per day
         is £30 saved per month.
      </p>
      <p class="p">Too many of us are paralyzed by the thought that we have to get every single part of our personal finances in order before
         truly getting started managing our money. Should I use my pension from work or open an ISA? Should I go for pooled funds or
         individual stocks? Do I need a variable annuity? Here’s my answer: Do you need to be the Iron Chef to cook a grilled-cheese
         sandwich? No, and once you make your first meal, it’ll be easier to cook the next most complicated thing. The single most
         important factor to getting rich is getting started, not being the smartest person in the room.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Put the Excuses Aside</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">L</span>isten up, crybabies: This isn’t your grandma’s house and I’m not going to bake you cookies and coddle you. A lot of your financial
         problems are caused by one person: you. Instead of blaming “the economy” and corporate America for your financial situation,
         you need to focus on what you can change yourself. Just as the diet industry has overwhelmed us with too many choices, personal
         finance is a confusing mess of overblown hype, myths, outright deception&mdash;and us, feeling guilty about not doing enough or
         not doing it right. But we can’t just blame corporations and the media: With both food and money, we’re not taking personal
         responsibility to step up, learn this stuff, and get started. The result is that many of us end up fat, consumption-minded,
         and poor. No, seriously: Two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, and the average American is nearly $7,000 in debt.
         In the UK the average debt is nearly £5,000, excluding mortgages.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">In 2008, when the global financial crisis really erupted in the stock market, the first thing many people did was pull their
         money out of the market. That’s almost always a bad move. They compounded one mistake&mdash;not having a diversified portfolio&mdash;with
         a second: buying high and selling low. For all the people who blamed the government, CEOs, and evil banks, had any of them
         read <em class="calibre2">one</em> personal finance book? And yet they expected to get ahead with their money?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s put the excuses aside. What if you could consciously decide how to spend your money, rather than say, “I guess that’s
         how much I spent last month”? What if you could build an automatic infrastructure that made all your accounts work together
         and automated your savings? What if you could invest simply and regularly without fear? Guess what? You can! I’ll show you
         how to take the money you’re making and redirect it to the places you want it to go&mdash;including substantially growing your money
         over the long term, no matter what the economy is like.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Key Messages of <em class="calibre13">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em></h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span> believe in small steps. I want to reduce the number of choices that paralyze us. It’s more important to get started than
         to spend an exhaustive amount of time researching the best fund in the universe. <em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> is about taking the first step&mdash;understanding the barriers that keep us from managing our money&mdash;and then tearing them down
         and putting our money in the right places so we can achieve our goals. Frankly, your goal probably isn’t to become a financial
         expert. It’s to live your life and let money serve you. So instead of saying, “How much money do I need to make?” you’ll say,
         “What do I want to do with my life&mdash; and how can I use money to do it?” And instead of being driven by fear, you’ll be guided
         by what history has shown us about investing and growth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’ll keep it simple: Too many books try to cover everything about money, leaving you holding a book that you “should” read
         but don’t because it’s overwhelming. I want you to know enough to get started setting up automated accounts and investing,
         even with just £50. So here are the essential messages of <em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You to Be Rich:</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert.</em></strong> Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s
         why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time&mdash;and not worry about being perfect. I’d rather act
         and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. Think about it: 85 percent of the way is far better than 0 percent. Once your
         money system is good enough&mdash;or 85 percent of the way there&mdash; you can get on with your life and go do the things you really
         want to do.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">It’s okay to make mistakes.</em></strong> It’s better to make them together now, with a little bit of money, so that when you have more, you’ll know what to avoid.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Ordinary actions get ordinary results.</em></strong> Most people are, by definition, ordinary. Yet more than half of a group of college graduates surveyed said they plan to be
         millionaires by the age of forty, an expectation that is not in line with reality. Look around you: How many of our parents
         are millionaires? Not many. And if we follow the same ordinary route they did, we’ll end up ordinary, too. To be extraordinary,
         you don’t have to be a genius, but you do need to take some different steps than your folks did (like starting to manage your
         money and investing early).
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">There’s a difference between being sexy and being rich.</em></strong> When I hear people talk about the stocks they bought, sold, or shorted last week, I realize that my investment style sounds
         pretty boring: “Well, I bought a few good funds five years ago and haven’t done anything since, except buy more on an automatic
         schedule.” But investment isn’t about being sexy&mdash;it’s about making money, and when you look at investment literature, buy-and-hold
         investing wins over the long term, every time. Forget what that money TV station or finance magazine says about the stock-of-the-month.
         Do some analysis, make your decision, and then reevaluate your investment every six months or so. It’s not as sexy as those
         guys in red coats shouting and waving their hands on TV, but as an individual investor, you’ll get far greater returns.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.</em></strong> This book isn’t about telling you to stop buying lattes. Instead, it’s about being able to actually spend <em class="calibre2">more</em> on the things you love by not spending money on all the knucklehead things you don’t care about. Look, it’s easy to want
         the best of everything: We want to go out all the time, live in a great apartment, buy new clothes, drive a new car, and travel
         any time we want. The truth is, you have to prioritize. My friend Jim once called to tell me that he’d gotten a raise at work.
         On the same day, he moved into a smaller apartment. Why? Because he doesn’t care very much about where he lives, but he loves
         spending money on camping and biking. That’s called conscious spending. (Learn how one of my friends consciously spends $21,000
       per year going out on <a href="#calibre_link-42">page 98</a>.)

      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> is about sensible banking, saving, spending, and investing. I’ll teach you how to set up your accounts to create an automatic
         financial infrastructure that will run smoothly with minimal intervention. You’ll also learn what to avoid, some surprising
         findings from financial literature (is real estate really a good investment?), and how to avoid common financial mistakes.
         And you’ll start taking action instead of debating minutiae. All this will take you just six weeks&mdash; then you’ll be on the
         road to being rich. Doesn’t that sound good?

      <p class="calibre6">When I was in high school, my parents told me that if I wanted to go to college, I’d need to pay for it with scholarships.
         So like a good Indian son, I started applying… and applying and applying. In the end, I’d applied for about seventy scholarships
         and had won hundreds of thousands of dollars.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But my best scholarship was the first one&mdash;an award for $2,000. The organization wrote a check directly to me. I took it and
         invested in the stock market&mdash;and immediately lost half my money.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Oops. That’s when I decided that I really needed to learn about money. I read the personal-finance books, watched the TV shows,
         and bought the magazines. After a while, I also started sharing what I’d learned. I taught informal classes to friends at
         Stanford. Then, in 2004, I began writing a blog called “I Will Teach You to Be Rich,” where I cover the basics of saving,
         banking, budgeting, and investing. The rest, as they say, is history.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Why Do You Want to Be Rich?</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>’ve talked to more than a million young people about personal finance over the last four years through my website and speaking
         engagements. When I do, I always ask two questions:
      </p>
      <p class="vtx"><em class="calibre2">Why do you want to be rich?</em></p>
      <p class="vtx1"><em class="calibre2">What does being rich mean to you?</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most people never spend even ten minutes thinking through what <em class="calibre2">rich</em> means to them. Suckers. Here’s a hint: It’s different for everyone, and money is just a small part of being rich. For example,
         my friends all value different things. Dan loves eating out at super gourmet restaurants where a meal might cost $100. Anton
         loves traveling. And Jen loves buying jeans. If you don’t consciously choose what <em class="calibre2">rich</em> means, it’s easy to end up mindlessly trying to keep up with your friends. I consider myself rich now that I can do these
         things:
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Make career decisions because I want to, not because of money</em></p>

         <p class="bl1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Start a scholarship fund for young entrepreneurs (launched in May 2006!)</em></p>
      <p class="p">Before you go further, I encourage you to set your goals today. Why do you want to be rich? What do you want to do with your
         wealth?
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">What You’ll Get Out of This Book</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span> love to laugh at people when they talk about investing. People think that investing means “buying stocks,” so they throw
         around fancy terms like <em class="calibre2">hedge funds, derivatives,</em> and <em class="calibre2">call options.</em> Sadly, they actually think you need this level of complexity to get rich because they see people talking about this stuff
         on TV each day. Guess what? For individual investors like you and me, these options are completely irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It sounds sexy, but when individual investors talk about complicated concepts like this, it’s like two elementary school tennis
         players arguing about the string tension of their racquets. Sure, it might matter a little, but they’d be much better tennis
         players if they just went outside and hit some balls for a few hours each day.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Simple, long-term investing works. This idea gets nothing but yawns and rolling eyes during a conversation. But you need to
         make a decision: Do you want to sit around impressing others with your sexy vocabulary, or do you want to join me on my gold-lined
         throne as we’re fed grapes and fanned with palm fronds?

      <p class="img"><img src="images/00026.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="cotx"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou’ll never see an Indian driving a two-door coupe. Seriously, think about it. If you have a neighborhood Indian&mdash;let’s call
         him Raj&mdash;he’s probably driving a four-door car, usually a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. However, Indian people aren’t just
         fanatical about driving practical four-door cars. We’re absolutely nuts about hammering down the price to the last penny.
         Take my dad, for example. He’ll bargain for <em class="calibre2">five straight days</em> just to buy one car. Dear God, it’s not pretty. I’ve been along for the ride on these weeklong negotiating sessions with
         him before. Once, as he was literally about to sign the papers, he stopped, asked them to throw in free floor mats (a $50
         value), and <em class="calibre2">walked away when they refused.</em> This, after he’d spent five days bargaining them down. As he dragged me from the dealership, I just stared straight ahead,
         shell-shocked.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As you can imagine, by the time I went to buy my own car, I had been steeped in a rich tradition of negotiating. I knew how
         to make unreasonable demands with a straight face and never take no for an answer. I took a more modern approach, however:
         Instead of spending a week going from dealership to dealership, I simply invited seventeen dealers in northern California
       to bid against one another for my business while I sat at home, watched <em class="calibre2">The Real World,</em> and calmly reviewed the e-mails and faxes as they came in. (For more about buying a car, see <a href="#calibre_link-20">page 244</a>.) In the end, I found
         a great deal in Palo Alto and walked in ready to sign the papers. Everything was going smoothly until the dealer went to check
         my credit. He came back smiling. “You know, you have the best credit of anyone I’ve ever seen at your age,” he said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Thanks,” I replied, actually wanting to say, “AWWW, YEAH, I KNEW IT.” That is because I am a weird twentysomething Indian
         who chooses a four-door Accord for his dream car and prides himself on his credit score.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Then the dealer said, “Hmm.”</p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Hmm?” I asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Well,” he said, “it looks like you have great credit, but not enough credit sources.” The bottom line, he told me, was that
         they couldn’t offer me the low-interest option we had talked about. Instead of 1.9 percent interest, it would be 4.9 percent.
         That didn’t sound like much, but I pulled out a notepad and did a quick calculation. The difference would be more than $2,200
         over the life of my car loan. Because I was getting such a great deal on the car, I convinced myself that the higher interest
         rate was okay, and I signed the papers for the loan. But I was still pissed. Why should I have to pay an extra two grand when
         I had great credit?
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">How Credit Can Help You Be Rich</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eople love to pick sexy investments and use fancy words like <em class="calibre2">distressed securities</em> and <em class="calibre2">EBITDA</em> when they focus on getting rich. But they often ignore something that is so simple, so basic, that it just doesn’t seem important:
         their credit. Ironically, credit is one of the most vital factors in getting rich, but because it’s hard to wrap our minds
         around it, we often overlook it entirely. It’s time to wake up and pay attention to it (and not just because of the credit
         crisis), because establishing good credit is the first step in building an infrastructure for getting rich. Think about it:
         Our largest purchases are almost always made on credit, and people with good credit save tens of thousands of pounds on these
         purchases. Credit has a far greater impact on your finances than saving a few pounds a day on a cup of coffee.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">What you saw in 2008 was the unraveling of credit, including personal spending that relied on unaffordable credit from credit
         cards and remortgaging. Those days of easy credit are gone (at least for a while until we forget history and do it all over
         again). So understanding your credit is more important than ever.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-23"></a>There are two main components to credit (also known as your credit history): the credit report and the credit score. These
         boring terms can actually save you tens of thousands of pounds over your lifetime, so listen up. This is what will enable
         you to justify heading to Vegas and staying at the Hugh Hefner suite at the Palms.

      <p class="spb"><a id="calibre_link-80"></a>Your <strong class="calibre7">credit report</strong> gives potential lenders&mdash;the people who are considering lending you money for a car or home&mdash;basic information about you, your

         higher weight.
      </p>
      <p class="spb">Your <strong class="calibre7">credit score</strong> is a single, easy-to-read number between 0 and 1000 that represents your credit risk to lenders. It’s like Cliff’s Notes
         for the credit industry. The lenders take this number (higher is better) and, with a few other pieces of information, such
         as your salary and age, decide if they’ll lend you money for credit like a credit card, mortgage, or car loan. They’ll charge
         you more or less for the loan, depending on the score, which signifies how risky you are. But each lender also has its own
         scoring system, so different lenders might give you a higher score.

      <p class="calibre6">Why are your credit report and credit score important? Because a good credit score can save you hundreds of thousands of pounds
         in interest charges. How? Well, if you have good credit, it makes you less risky to lenders, meaning they can offer you a
         better interest rate on loans. “But Ramit,” you might say naively, “I don’t care about this. I don’t need to borrow money.”
         Maybe you don’t today. But in three or four years, you might need to start thinking about a wedding or a house. What about
         cars? Vacations? Those ridiculous baby cribs that cost £7,000? And it goes on and on.

      <p class="calibre6">So please don’t scoff or dismiss what you just read. One of the key differences between rich people and everyone else is that

         with lattes, they’re failing to see the bigger picture. It’s fine to be frugal, but you should focus on spending time on the
         things that matter, the <em class="calibre2">big wins.</em> So, let’s dig into tactics for improving your credit, which is quantifiably worth much more than any advice about frugality.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Building Credit with Credit Cards</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">C</span>redit comes in many forms (car loans, mortgages, and so on), but we’re going to start with credit cards because almost all
         of us have one, and most important, they’re the fastest and most concrete way to optimize your credit. Most people are making
         at least one or two major mistakes with their credit cards. The good news is that it’s incredibly easy to fix this by learning
         a little bit about how credit cards work.

      <p class="calibre6">From one perspective, credit cards are like a delightful gift from heaven. If you pay your bill on time, they’re actually
         a free short-term loan. They help you keep track of your spending much more easily than cash, and online card providers let
         you download your transaction history for free. All credit cards offer free consumer protection (unless they’re business cards)
         and some may have extra benefits too. But unfortunately, there’s more to them than that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Credit cards are also convenient enemies. Almost everyone has a bad story about late fees, unauthorized charges, or overspending.
         Not surprisingly, many pundits (and parents) have a knee-jerk reaction to credit cards: “Using credit cards is the worst financial
         decision you can make,” they shout. “Cut them all up!” What an easy battle cry for people who want simple solutions and don’t
         realize the benefits of multiple sources of credit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The truth about credit cards lies somewhere between these two extremes. As long as you manage them well, they’re worth having.
         But if you don’t completely pay off your bill at the end of the month, you’ll owe an enormous amount of interest on the remainder,
         usually about 16 percent. This is what’s known as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Credit card companies also tack on a
         whopping fee every time you miss a payment&mdash;usually around £12. And don’t forget the fees for making a payment even just a
         day or two late. It’s also easy to overuse credit cards and find yourself in debt, as so many credit card users have done.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most of us don’t think about these fees. We just charge away and then make our monthly payments, right? Unfortunately, although
         they’re not obvious, credit card charges are some of the largest unnecessary fees you’ll ever pay&mdash;much more than the costs
         of eating out once a week or buying that nice outfit you’ve been eyeing.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">This isn’t meant to scare you away from using credit cards. In fact, I encourage you to use credit cards <em class="calibre2">responsibly</em>. If you can avoid the unreasonable fees and tricks, credit cards offer exceptional benefits (more on this later). To get
         the most out of using credit, you need to optimize your credit card(s) and use them as a spearhead to improve your overall
         credit. This is all the more important in the wake of the credit crisis; if you don’t have good credit, it may be difficult
         to get an affordable home loan&mdash;even if you have a high income. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to squeeze the
         credit card companies for everything they’re worth&mdash;without paying unnecessary fees or late charges&mdash;and you’ll know how to
         use your cards to boost your all-important credit score. Let’s do it.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Getting a New Card</h1>
      <p class="calibre6"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’ve never had a credit card before or you’re thinking about getting an additional card, there are a few things to
         think about.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Avoid those credit card offers you receive in the mail.</em></strong> Let’s cut to the chase: If you hate those credit card offers in the mail as much as I do, visit 
         <a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk">www.mpsonline.org.uk</a> to get off their lists. The average American receives twenty credit card offers every year, and four out of every thousand
         people accept them. The numbers are markedly different for students. Out of every thousand students who are mailed offers,
         150 accept them, an astonishingly high number. Students&mdash;and young people in general&mdash;are especially susceptible to these offers
         because they don’t know any better. Let’s get real. Taking a credit card offer you get in the mail is like marrying the first
         person who touches your arm&mdash;99 percent of the time it’s the easy decision, not the right one. Most people know better and
         go out and find what’s best for them; they don’t just settle for the horrible offers that fall in their lap. For something
         as important as your credit, make the effort and pick a good card.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Avoid cash-back cards, which don’t actually pay you much cash.</em></strong> People get really mad at me when I say this, but cash-back cards are worthless. “Get 1 percent back on all your spending!”
         Wow, if I spend £2,000 per month on my credit card, I’ll get back £20. “But Ramit,” you might say, “twenty pounds is better
         than nothing.” Sure, but what if you could save more by getting a free £500 flight? It wouldn’t be as obvious as receiving
         money each month, but in the long term, you’d save more with a travel rewards card.
      </p>
<p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Getting a Credit Card When You Have No Income</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">A</span> while ago, one of my friends called me and asked if she could borrow my credit card to buy something online. “How come? Don’t
         you have a credit card?” I asked. Given all the benefits of having a card (assuming you use it wisely), you can imagine how
         angry I was when I learned that she didn’t have a card of her own. In my mind, this was the equivalent of one of Dr. Koop’s
         friends being morbidly obese because of eating only butter.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Anyway, I told her to get a credit card and start building her credit. Her response: “I can’t get approved for a credit card
         because I have no income.”
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Okay, fair enough. Getting your first credit card can be tricky, especially if you’re young. But there’s an easy solution:
         Get a credit building card. These cards can have hefty interest rates of 30% or more, but if you pay off whatever you owe
         in full, it won’t matter. After a year or so, assuming you’ve behaved responsibly, you can graduate to a lower rate card or
         get a regular one if your income level justifies it. To get one, call your bank and ask about it.
      </p>
    </div>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Compare cards online.</em></strong> The best way to find a card that is right for you is by researching different offers online (try 
         <a href="http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk">www.moneyfacts.co.uk</a>). In most cases, the simplest credit cards are offered by your bank, so this is often a good place to look. They’ll connect
         with your bank account and you can choose from a variety of options, including credit limit, rewards, and more. On the plus
         side, they’re easy to get without much research. The downside is that the rewards are usually fairly mediocre.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Rewards are important.</em></strong> You’re going to be using this card a fair amount, so make sure the rewards it offers are something you’ll actually want.
         I travel a lot, so I got an airline card that gives me free companion tickets, free flights, and points for every dollar I
         spend and every mile I fly. I get multiple free flights per year, and each one saves me about $350. But if you hardly ever
         travel, this card wouldn’t make sense for you. Bottom line: If you’re getting a rewards card, find one that gives you something
         you value.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Don’t go card crazy.</em></strong> Now that you’re in the market, you might be tempted by any number of card offers. But don’t overdo it. There’s no magic number
         of cards you should have. But each additional card you get means added complexity for your personal-finance system. Two or
         three is a good rule of thumb. (The average American has four credit cards.) Your credit score is based on overall sources
         of credit. Remember, there are other sources of credit besides credit cards. These include installment loans (such as auto
         loans), personal lines of credit, home equity lines of credit, and service credit (such as utilities). “Take it slow,” Craig
         Watts of Fair Isaac Corporation says, cautioning against prescribing a specific number of credit sources. “It depends on how
         long you’ve been managing credit. The less information in your credit report, the higher the prominence of each new report.
         For example, if you’re in college and you only have one credit card in your name, when you open another account, the weight
         of that action is more than it would be ten years down the line. If you limit yourself to opening one card a year, you’ll
         be doing yourself a favor.”
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Six Commandments of Credit Cards</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow it’s time to take full advantage of your cards as a means to improving your credit. Optimizing your credit is a multi-step
         process. One of the most important factors is getting out of debt, which we’ll tackle at the end of the chapter. But first,
         we’ll set up automatic credit card payments so you never miss a payment again. Then, we’ll see how to cut fees, get better
         rewards, and take everything you can from the credit card companies. (Hey, it’s business, and they’re in it to get your money,
         too.)
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">1. Pay off your credit card regularly.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Yeah, we’ve all heard it, but what you may not know is that your debt payment history represents 35 percent of your credit
         score&mdash;the largest <a id="calibre_link-28"></a>chunk. In fact, the single most important thing you can do to improve your credit is to pay your bills on
         time. Whether you’re paying the full amount of your credit card bill or risking my wrath by paying just part of it, <em class="calibre2">pay it on time.</em> Lenders like prompt payers, so don’t give your credit card company the opportunity to raise your rates and lower your credit
         score by being a few days late with your payment. This is a great example of focusing on what will get you rich, not on what’s
         sexy. Think about your friends who catalog every single website to get the best deals on travel or clothes. They might be
         thrilled after saving £10&mdash;and they can brag to everyone about all the special deals they get&mdash;but you’ll quietly save thousands
         by understanding the invisible importance of credit, paying your bills on time, and having a better credit score.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Awful Consequences</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you miss even one payment on your credit card, here are four terrible, horrible, no good, very bad results you may face:
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1.</strong> Your credit score can drop. The amount will vary from lender to lender and future borrowing could be more difficult and expensive.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2.</strong> Your credit card provider may raise your interest rate or lower your limit.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">3.</strong> You’ll be charged a late fee, usually around £12.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1b"><strong class="calibre7">4.</strong> Your late payment can trigger rate increases on your other credit cards as well, even if you’ve never been late on them because
         many lenders monitor existing customers’ credit reports. (I find this fact amazing.)
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Don’t get too freaked out: You can recover from the hit to your credit score, usually within a few months. In fact, if you’re
         just a few days late with your payment, you may incur a fee, but it won’t always be reported to the credit reference agencies.

<p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Paying your bills on time is absolutely critical,” says FICO’s Craig Watts. “It’s by far the most important thing you can
         do to improve your credit rating.” If you miss a credit card payment, you might as well just get a shovel and repeatedly beat
         yourself in the face. The credit card companies are going to get you&mdash;and the worst part is, you earned it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Many people pay their credit card bills online or by phone. If you haven’t set up a direct debit yet, log on to your bank’s
         website to set it up now. Note: Don’t worry if you don’t always have enough money in your current account to pay off the full
         amount you owe on your credit card. You’ll get an e-mail from your card company each month before the payment goes through
         so that you can adjust your payment as needed.

      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">I just totally forgot the due date for my credit card. So not only did they charge me a late fee, but they charged me interest
            on that month’s and the previous month’s purchases. I called up the customer service line of my credit card and told them
            that I had been a good customer in the past, and asked if they could do anything for me with the fees. The representative
            removed the late fee and refunded $20 of the interest charge back to my account. They returned a total of $59 to me with one
            phone call.</em></p>

      <p class="p">This is a great, easy way to optimize your credit cards because your credit card company will do all the work for you. Call
         them using the phone number on the back of the card and ask if you’re paying any fees, including annual fees or service charges.

      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">N</span>obody’s perfect. Despite my warnings, I understand that accidents happen and you might miss a payment at some point. When
         this happens, I use my Indian heritage to beat the companies by negotiating with them, and you can, too:
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this won’t affect my credit score.

      <p class="btx1">(Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t be reported to the credit agencies. Call them to
         be sure.)
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee… I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived.

      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CREDIT CARD REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Why?</em></p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> It was a mistake and it won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee removed.

      <p class="btx1">(Note: Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At
         this point, you have a better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your account. But just in case you get
         an especially tough rep, here’s what to say.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CREDIT CARD REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">I’m very sorry, but we can’t refund that fee. I can try to get you our latest blah blah marketing pitch blah blah….</em></p>

      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CREDIT CARD REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Hmm… Let me check on that…. Yes, I was able to remove the fee this time. It’s been credited to your account.</em></p>
      <p class="btx1">You don’t believe me that it can be so simple? It is. Anyone can do it.</p>
</div>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Hi, I’d like to confirm that I’m not paying any fees on my credit card.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CREDIT CARD REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Well, it looks like you have an annual fee of £35. That’s actually one of our better rates.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> I’d rather pay no fees. Which card can you switch me to that doesn’t charge fees? I’d like to make sure my credit score isn’t
         affected by closing this account, too. Can you confirm?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Yes, I really talk like that.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">The vast majority of people don’t need to pay any annual fees on their credit cards, and because free credit cards are so
         competitive now, you rarely need to pay for the privilege of using your card. The only exception is if you spend enough to
         justify the extra rewards a fee-charging account offers. (If you do pay an annual fee, use the break-even calculator on my
         website to see if it’s worth it.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most people should switch from a for-fee card to a free card, so ask your credit card company what they’ll do for you. If
         they waive your fees, great! If not, switch to a no-fee credit card. I suggest you do this at the same credit card company
         to simplify your life&mdash;and so you don’t have to close one account and open another, which will affect your credit score. If
         you decide to close the account and get a new credit card, look for one with no fees and good rewards (read more about those
         on <a href="#calibre_link-21">page 29</a>).
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">3. Negotiate a lower APR.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Your APR, or annual percentage rate, is the interest rate your credit card company charges you. The average APR is 16 percent,
         which makes it extremely expensive if you carry a balance on your card. Put another way, since you can make an average of
         about 8 percent in the stock market, your credit card is getting a great deal by lending you money. If you could get a 16
         percent return, you’d be thrilled&mdash;you want to avoid the black hole of credit card interest payments so <em class="calibre2">you</em> can earn money, not give it to the credit card companies.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">So, call your credit card company and ask them to lower your APR. If they ask why, tell them you’ve been paying the full amount
         of your bill on time for the last few months, and you know there are a number of credit cards offering better rates than you’re
         currently getting. In my experience, this works about half the time. It’s important to note that your APR doesn’t technically
         matter if you’re paying your bills in full every month&mdash;you could have a 2 percent APR or 80 percent APR and it would be irrelevant,
         since you don’t pay interest if you pay your total bill each month. But this is a quick and easy way to pick the low-hanging
         fruit with one phone call.
      </p>

      <p class="p">Lenders like to see a long history of credit, which means that the longer you hold an account, the more valuable it is for
         your credit score. Don’t get suckered by introductory offers and low APRs. If you’re happy with your card, keep it. And if
         you’re getting a new credit card, don’t close the account on your old one. Having more than one ‘active’ card can improve
         your credit score. As long as there are no fees, keep it open and use it occasionally, because some credit card companies
         will cancel your account after a certain period of inactivity or will start to charge you an annual fee. To avoid paying these
         or having your account shut down, set up a direct debit on any card that is not your primary card. For example, I set it up
         so that one of my credit cards pays a $12.95 monthly subscription through my checking account each month, which requires zero
         intervention on my part. But my credit report reflects that I’ve had the card for more than five years, which improves my
         credit score. Play it safe: If you have a credit card, keep it active using an automatic payment at least once every three
         months.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5. Get more credit. (Warning! Do this only if you have no debt.)</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">This one is counterintuitive, and to explain it, I had to reach into personal-finance lessons of yore. Many people don’t realize
         this, but in the classic ’80s Salt ’N Pepa song “Push It,” when they say that the dance isn’t for everybody&mdash;“<em class="calibre2">Only the sexy people”&mdash;</em>they are actually detailing a sound personal-finance strategy:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Before I explain, I want to first acknowledge that yes, I did just quote Salt ’N Pepa in an actual, published book. Anyway,
         when Salt ’N Pepa talk about “only the sexy people,” what they really mean is “this tip is only for the financially responsible
         people.” I’m serious about this warning: This tip is only for people who have no credit card debt and pay their bills in full
         each month. It’s not for anyone else.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If lenders can see that their competitors have given you credit and you haven’t fully used your card up to its limit, they
         will feel more comfortable about extending more credit to you. If one lender can displace a competitor’s card, it’s a double
         whammy (its own business goes up at the cost of its competitor). These are the daily joys that the credit card companies enjoy.
         Most lenders don’t take your credit utilisation rate into account (that’s the amount of money you owe divided by the amount
         you could borrow, multiplied by 100). However, for those that do, it is true to say that if you had two credit cards and owed
         £500 on each (with a £1,000 credit limit), you would be seen as a better risk than someone who had one credit card with a
         £1,000 limit, on which they owed £1,000.

<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">U</span>nfortunately for you, credit card companies are very good at using B.S. late fees to increase their revenues. Unfortunately
         for them, I’m giving you lots of tactics for getting these fees reversed. One of the best ways to improve your chances of
         getting fees waived is by keeping track of every time you call your financial institutions. This is especially true of credit
         card companies, whom you should treat just slightly better than you would an armed militia coming after your younger sister.
         It’s tempting, when calling, to be really nasty, but because I was raised right, I don’t scream or threaten violence. Instead,
         when I call to dispute anything, I open a spreadsheet that details the last time I called them, whom I spoke with, and what
         was resolved. If only all criminals were as diligent as I am. (Unfortunately, in the UK it can be more difficult to get fees
         waived, but it’s always worth trying.)

         I spend enough to justify the cost. With this card, I earn one point for every dollar I spend and one point for every mile

         off increasing your credit limit.

      <p class="p">Before I get into rewards programs, let me say this: Just like with car insurance, you can get great deals on your credit
         when you’re a responsible customer. In fact, there are lots of tips for people who have <em class="calibre2">very good</em> credit. If you fall in this category, you should call your credit cards and lenders once per year to ask them what advantages
         you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit, and give you private promotions that others don’t have access
         to. Call them up and use this line:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Hi there. I just checked my credit and noticed that I have a 900 credit score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer
         of yours for the last four years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me… I’m thinking of special
         offers that you use for customer retention.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Credit cards also offer rewards programs that give you cash back, airline tickets, and other benefits, but most people don’t
         take advantage of all the free stuff they can get. For example, when I had to fly to a wedding in an obscure town in Wisconsin,
         I redeemed my credit card’s travel reward to save more than $600 on the flight. That’s an easy one, but there’s better: Did
         you know that credit cards automatically give you amazing consumer protection? Here are a few examples you might not know
         about:
      </p>
            <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, you are protected if you buy goods costing between £100 and £30,000. If the
         goods don’t arrive, aren’t of suitable quality or the supplier goes bust, you can make a claim against the credit card company.      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Some credit card providers offer an extended warranty if you buy electrical goods and gadgets on your card. You normally
         have to register them within a specified time limit.      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;You may get free travel insurance if you pay for your holiday with your card. But check the excess levels, how much medical
         cover you have and whether winter sports are included.      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of exclusive credit cards (generally those that charge a hefty annual fee) come with a concierge service. They
         can track down hard-to-find concert or sports tickets, classic cars or plan your holiday for you.

<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce, when I canceled my Sprint cell phone service, they told me my account had a $160 charge. For what? I asked. Wait for
         it….
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">“An early cancellation fee.”</p>
      <p class="btx1">Yeah, right. I knew I didn’t have a contract, and I had negotiated out of an early cancellation fee a long time before that.
         (Mobile phone companies make a lot of money from trying these shady moves, hoping customers will get frustrated, give up,
         and just pay.) Unfortunately for them, ever since Sprint had started trying to rip me off three years before, I had kept records
         of every phone conversation I’d had with them. The customer-service rep was very polite, but insisted she couldn’t do anything
         to erase the charge.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Really? I’ve heard this tune before, so I pulled out the notes I had taken the previous year and politely read them aloud
         to her.

      <p class="btx1">As soon as I read them, I experienced a miraculous change in her ability to waive the fee. Within two minutes, my account

      <p class="btx1">Wouldn’t it be great if that were the end of the story? Although they told me they wouldn’t charge me, they did it anyway.
         By this point, I was so fed up that I called in the big guns.

      <p class="btx1">Many people don’t know that credit cards offer excellent consumer protection. This is one reason I encourage everyone to make

      <p class="btx1">I called my credit card company and told them I wanted to dispute a charge. They said, “Sure; what’s your address and what’s
         the amount?” When I told them about my experience with Sprint, they instantly gave me a temporary credit for the amount and
         told me to mail in a form with my complaint, which I did.

      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Plan how you use your credit cards.</em></strong> Closing accounts doesn’t harm your credit score negatively and some lenders may prefer to see that you don’t have a large
         line of unused credit. The idea being that if you were to make use of all the credit, you could move from ‘coping well’ to
         ‘in serious debt’ pretty quickly. On the other hand, it’s better not to have just one card and to max out on it. If you have
         two cards that you’ve not borrowed up to the limit on, that will be better. Of course, you should pay it off in full each
         month anyway, otherwise you’re just adding to the credit card company’s profits and they’re normally quite good at making
         money without help.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Make sure all bills have been paid in good time.</em></strong> Your credit record shows your payment history over the last 12 months. Lenders will want to see you’ve managed all your accounts
         well, particularly in the last six months.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Register on the electoral roll.</em></strong> It’s the easiest step to take, but it could make all the difference to your ability to get credit. It may not technically
         harm your score, but lenders check the electoral roll to make sure that you are who you say you are. Check out 
         <a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk">www.aboutmyvote.co.uk</a> to find out how to register.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Don’t play the zero percent transfer game.</em></strong> Some people have started playing the 0 percent transfer game to profit off of credit cards by making balance transfers or
         taking cash advances. They take the introductory zero percent APR that you get when you open many credit cards (which usually
         only lasts for six months). Then they borrow money from the card at this low rate and stick it in a high-interest savings
         account, which allows them to profit off the interest. Some actually invest the money in short-term bonds or even stocks.
         At the end, they plan to return the money and keep the interest. I find these 0 percent credit card games so moronic. Sure,
         you can make a few quid a year, or maybe even a few hundred, but the waste of time, risk of mismanaging the process, and possibility
         of screwing up your credit score just aren’t worth it. Most important, this is a distraction that gets you only short-term
         results. You’re much better off building a personal-finance infrastructure that focuses on long-term growth, not on getting
         a few quid here or there. Dave Ramsey, a popular personal-finance author and radio host, specializes in helping people get
         out of debt. He says, “I have met with thousands of millionaires in my years as a financial counselor, and I have never met
         one who said he made it all with Discover Card bonus points. They all lived on less than they made and spent only when they
         had cash.” Focus on the big wins if you want bigger results.

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Oh No! My Credit Score Just Dropped</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ome of my Type-A readers worry too much about their credit scores. If your credit score suddenly drops, first you should figure
       out why by getting a copy of your credit report and score (see <a href="#calibre_link-23">page 15</a>). Then what’s important is how you deal with it going
         forward. Your credit score can start recovering immediately as more positive information is reported, like paying your bills
         on time. So work to manage your credit wisely and consistently. As FICO’s Craig Watts notes, “The natural movement of these
         scores is to slowly grow. How do you think people end up with scores above 900? It’s through years and years of consistently
         boring credit management.”

         on them in thirty-six-point type. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen someone standing in front of me at The Gap or
         Bloomingdale’s who gets suckered into these cards. “If you sign up today, you’ll get 10 percent off your purchase!” the clerks
         say. They forget to mention that these cards, with an average APR of 20&ndash;25 percent and low credit limits, are issued to people
         with little regard for how credit-worthy they are. And, predictably, they contain some of the most onerous terms of any cards,
         including tremendous rate increases if your payment is late even once. And for what? Twenty pounds off a single purchase?
         Ask yourself if it’s worth it. Here, I’ll just tell you: It’s not. Stay away from store cards.

         between 0.65 and 0.85 percent higher than my operating money market account…. That’s an extra $300/year in interest, which
         is definitely worth changing banks every four to six months for me.”
      </p>
      <p class="btx1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY RESPONSE</small>:</strong> “Mike, if you were smart enough to sock away $40k in an emergency fund (which is really impressive, by the way), I bet you’re
         smart enough to spend your time doing something better than earning $300/year&mdash;something that will let you earn much more sustainably.
       You’re only earning $0.82/day doing that! How about spending the same time optimizing your asset allocation? (see <a href="#calibre_link-24">page 170</a>)
         That step alone is probably worth thousands per year. Or starting a side business? Or even spending those few hours with your
         family? I don’t know what you value, but in my eyes, any of those things would produce more value than $300/year… especially
         for someone who’s so far ahead of everyone else, like you are. This is just my two cents… about 1/40th of what you earned
         today (sorry, couldn’t resist).”

      <p class="btx1">Focus on the big wins to get the big results. They may not be as obvious or sexy as jumping from account to account and getting
         a few extra bucks, but the big wins will make you rich over the long term.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tatistically speaking, being in debt is normal. And yet, think about it: Is it really normal to owe more than you have? Maybe
         for certain things, like a house or education, but what about for random purchases on a credit card?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Some people differentiate debts by calling them “good debt” and “bad debt,” depending on if the debt appreciates (education)
         or depreciates (car) over time. Others despise debt altogether. Whatever the case, most of us have a lot of it. And it doesn’t
         feel good.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I want to talk about student loans and credit card debt, the two largest types of debt facing most twentysomethings and thirtysomethings.
         They get in the way of your getting rich, so I want to help you knock these barriers down with a simple plan.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE BURDEN OF STUDENT LOANS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I’m not going to lie to you: Getting rid of student loan debt is hard. The average student graduates with about £16,000 of
         debts, but those on longer courses (doctors, etc.) could have more than £30,000 of loans to pay off. Unfortunately, it’s not
         like you can just wave a magic wand and make it disappear. In fact, even if you declare bankruptcy, you’ll still have to pay
         your student loans. However, even if you have huge student debt, I want you to pay attention to how much money you’re putting
         toward the monthly payments. Because the loan amounts are so large, even an extra £100/month can save you years of payments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s look at an example. “Tony” owes £8,100 to the Student Loans Company (which is the amount the average student owed the
         SLC in 2009) and pays 9% of his salary above £15,000. He earns £22,000 so his payment is £52.50 a month. He’s currently paying
         0 per cent interest (this may look great for now, but watch out because interest rates alter every year). If you can afford
         to, increase your student loan payments. But only do this once you’ve cleared your other&mdash;more expensive&mdash;debts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most of us accept our student debt as is. We get a bill each month, we pay it, and we shrug, frustrated about the burden of
         our loans but not really sure if we can do anything. Guess what: <em class="calibre2">You can change your student loan payments.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">First, to inspire you to take action on paying off your student debt, play with the financial calculators at 
         <a href="http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/tools.aspx?Tool=loan_calculator">http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/tools.aspx?Tool=loan_calculator</a>. You’ll be able to see how paying different amounts changes the total amount you’ll owe.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Second, I want to encourage you to put at least £50 more each month toward any debt you have. Not only is it a psychological
         victory to know that you’re consciously working to pay off your debt, but you’ll also be able to focus on investing sooner.
         Make sure this is automatic, drawing right out of your checking account, so you don’t even see the money. (I describe automatic
         payments in <a href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter 5</a>.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, if you’re having problems paying off the student overdraft you graduated with (which may be interest-free for a couple
         of years after you graduate) it’s time to call your bank. Look at the phone number on that monthly bill you keep ignoring.
         Call them up and ask them for their advice. I can’t emphasize this enough: <em class="calibre2">Call them.</em> Your lenders have heard it all, from “I can’t pay this month” to “I have five different loans and want to consolidate them.”
         You’ll want to ask them the following:
      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">What would happen if I paid £100 more per month? (Substitute in the right amount for you.)</em></p>
       <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">What would happen if I took longer to bring my overdraft or loan down?</em></p>
         <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">If you’re looking for a job, you might ask, What if I’m looking for a job and can’t afford to pay for the next three months?</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Your lender has answers to all these questions&mdash;and chances are they can help you find a better way to structure your payment.
         Typically, they’ll help you by changing the monthly payment or the time line. Just think: With that one call you could save
         hundreds of pounds.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHEN CREDIT CARDS GO BAD</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Just like with gaining weight, most people don’t get into serious credit card debt overnight. Instead, things go wrong little
         by little until they realize they’ve got a serious problem. If you’ve ended up in credit card debt, it can seem overwhelming.
         When you watch Dr. Phil, you wonder why those people can’t figure out how to solve their problems when the answers are so
         clear: “Yes, you should leave him! He hasn’t had a job for the last eight years! And he looks like a rat. Are you blind?”
         But when we have our own problems, the answers don’t seem so simple. What should you do? How do you manage your day-to-day
         finances? And why do things keep getting worse? The good news is that credit card debt is almost always manageable if you
         have a plan and take disciplined steps to reduce it. Yes, it’s hard, but you <em class="calibre2">can</em> get out of debt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now, almost nothing makes people feel guiltier than having credit card debt. Seventy-five percent of Americans claim they
         don’t make major purchases on their credit card unless they can pay it off immediately. Yet from looking at actual spending
         behaviors, 70 percent of Americans carry a balance and fewer than half are willing to reveal their credit card debt to a friend.
         Those numbers are an indication that American consumers are ashamed of their debt levels, says Greg McBride, a senior financial
         analyst from 
         <a href="http://www.bankrate.com">www.bankrate.com</a>, which commissioned the study. Referring to a recent study on consumer behavior, he told me, “They [are] more willing to
         give their name, age, and even details of their sex life than provid[e] the amount of their credit card debt.” Really? Their
         sex lives? I would like to talk to these people… alone.
      </p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">When I was engaged, I asked my credit union to raise my Visa limit of $500 to $1,500. This was a horrible mistake. My wedding
            dress budget of $500 suddenly became $1,200 when I “fell in love” with a dress in a boutique. I’ve paid only the minimum balance
            on my Visa each month, since emergency expenses seem to be keeping our budget stretched paper-thin, so I’m throwing away $30
            or more per month in interest for a credit card balance from just one day in my life. My husband and I will most likely be
            paying for the wedding for years to come.</em></p>
      <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre7">&mdash;<small class="calibre10">CLAIRE STUBBLEFIELD, 24</small></strong></p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">This shame means that those in debt often don’t educate themselves on how to stop the madness. Instead, they fall victim to
         the credit card companies’ nefarious practices, which prey on the uninformed&mdash;and the undisciplined. These companies have become
         very good at extracting more money from us, and we’ve become very bad at knowing enough to say no.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">For instance, the number one mistake people make with their credit cards is carrying a balance, or not paying it off every
         month. Astonishingly, of the 115 million Americans who carry a monthly credit card balance, half of them pay only their minimum
         monthly payments. Sure, it’s tempting to think that you can buy something and pay it off little by little, but because of
         credit cards’ insanely high interest rates, that’s a critical mistake.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s say it again: The key to using credit cards effectively is to pay off your credit card in full every month. I know I
         said that prosaically, in the same way someone would ask you to pass the salt, but it is REALLY IMPORTANT. Ask your friend
         with £12,000 in credit card debt how it happened. Chances are he’ll shrug and tell you he decided to “just pay the minimum”
         every month.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m not going to belabor the point, but you would be <em class="calibre2">shocked</em> by how many people I talk to who charge purchases without knowing how much they’ll actually end up paying once interest is
         figured in. Paying the minimum amount on your credit card is the grown-up equivalent of a little boy letting the school bully
         take his lunch money on the first day of school, then coming back with his pockets jingling every single day afterward. Not
         only are you going to get your ass kicked, but it’s going to happen again and again. But by learning how the system works,
         you can figure out how to avoid the card companies’ traps and get out of debt more quickly.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">PAY YOUR DEBT OFF AGGRESSIVELY</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you’ve found yourself in credit card debt&mdash;whether it’s a lot or a little&mdash; you have a triple whammy working against you:</p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;First, you’re paying tons of high interest on the balance you’re carrying.</p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, your credit score may suffer. Some lenders will mark you down and they won’t like it if it looks like you are up
         to your limit on all your lines of credit.
      </p>
      <p class="bl4b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and potentially most damaging, debt can affect you emotionally. It can overwhelm you, leading you to avoid opening
         your bills, causing more late payments and more debt, in a downward spiral of doom.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It’s time to make sacrifices to pay off your debt quickly. Otherwise, you’re costing yourself more and more every day. Don’t
         put it off, because there’s not going to be a magic day when you win a million pounds or “have enough time” to figure out
         your finances. You said that three years ago! Managing your money has to be a priority if you ever want to be in a better
         situation than you are today.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-70"></a>Think about it: The average interest rate on credit cards is a hefty 16 percent, which means you’re likely paying a tremendous
         amount of interest on any balance you’re carrying. To see how this plays out, let’s assume someone has £5,000 in debt on a
         card with 16 percent APR. If Dumb Dan pays the monthly minimum payment of 2.5%, it will take him over twenty-seven years to
         pay off this debt&mdash;assuming he doesn’t rack up more debt, which you know he will. Over the entire process, he’ll pay nearly
         £5,300 <em class="calibre2">in interest alone.</em> Smart Sally, by contrast, decides to pay £250 each month, which is double the minimum payment. It takes her just two years
         to pay off the full debt, and she pays less than £900 in interest. Plus, since it’s automatically withdrawn from her current
         account each month, she doesn’t even notice the extra money she’s paying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s just from paying £250 every single month. Don’t have £250 extra? How about £50? Or even £20? Any increase over the
         minimum helps.
      </p>
    <p class="calibre6">If you set up automatic payments (which I discuss on <a href="#calibre_link-25">page 131</a>) and work your debt down, you won’t pay fees anymore. You won’t
         pay finance charges. You’ll be free to grow your money by looking ahead. In the credit card companies’ eyes you’ll be a “deadbeat,”
         a curious name American card firms use for customers who pay on time every month and therefore produce virtually no revenue.
         You’ll be worthless in their eyes, which is perfect in mine. But to beat them, you have to prioritize paying off whatever
         you already owe.

      <p class="p">Not all debts are created equal. Different cards charge you different interest rates, which can affect what you decide to
         pay off first. There are two schools of thought on how to go about this. In the standard method, you pay the minimum on all
         cards, but pay more money to the card with the <em class="calibre2">highest APR</em>, because it’s costing you the most. In the Dave Ramsey Snowball method, you pay the minimum on all cards, but pay more money
         to the card with the <em class="calibre2">lowest balance</em> first&mdash;the one that will allow you to pay it off first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">This is a source of fierce debate in credit card circles. Technically, the Snowball method isn’t necessarily the most efficient
         approach, because the card with the lowest balance doesn’t necessarily have the highest APR. But on a psychological level,
         it’s enormously rewarding to see one credit card paid off, which in turn can motivate you to pay off others more quickly.
         Bottom line: Don’t spend more than five minutes deciding. Just pick one method and do it. The goal is not to optimize your
         payoff method, but to get started paying off your debt.

      <p class="p">I’m a huge fan of taking 50/50 odds if the upside is big and it takes only five minutes of my time. Accordingly, try negotiating
         down your APR. It works surprisingly often and if it doesn’t, so what? Just call your card companies and follow this script:
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Hi, I’m going to be paying off my credit card debt more aggressively beginning next week and I’d like a lower APR.

      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CREDIT CARD REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Hmm… After reviewing your account, I’m afraid we can’t offer you a lower APR. We can offer you a credit limit increase, however.</em></p>

         months, as well as APRs of half what you’re offering. I’ve been a customer for X years, and I’d prefer not to switch my balance
         over to a low-interest card. Can you match the other credit card rates, or can you go lower?

      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">4. Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">One common barrier to paying off debt is wondering where the money should come from. Balance transfers? Should you use your
         ISA money or your savings account? How much should you be paying off every month? These questions can be daunting, but don’t
         let them stop you.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BALANCE TRANSFERS</small>.</strong> Many people begin by considering a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR. I’m not a fan of these. Yes, it can help
         for a few months and save you some money, particularly on large balances. But this is just a Band-Aid for a larger problem
         (usually your spending behavior, when it comes to credit card debt), so changing the interest rate isn’t going to address
         that. Plus, balance transfers are a confusing process fraught with tricks by credit card companies to trap you into paying
         more, and the people I’ve known who do this end up spending more time researching the best balance transfers than actually
         paying their debt off. As we just discussed, a better option is to call and negotiate the APR down on your current accounts.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">TAKING OUT A SECURED LOAN OR REMORTGAGING.</small></strong> I don’t recommend the first option because you’re converting unsecured debt into a loan that is secured on your home. You’ll
         be adding to your monthly payments and possibly even jeopardising your home if you can’t keep up the repayments. Remortgaging
         to a lower rate and adding your credit card debt to your loan means you’ve reduced the amount of equity you have. That might
         mean you miss out on the best mortgage deals or even&mdash;if prices fall&mdash;that you’re in negative equity.

The most sustainable way to pay off credit card debt is also the least sexy. Unlike balance transfers

         on other things so you could pay off your debt. But it works.

      <p class="eps">&mdash; Ramit</p>
      
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span><em class="calibre2">t’s fine to use credit cards as tools for convenient spending and to rack up “bonus points,” as long as you’re aware of the</em> possibility<em class="calibre2"> you are subtly spending more due to the ease of use. I would even understand it if you use a credit card in an emergency
            situation when no other options are available. But when you use that same card to buy products or experiences</em> you cannot afford<em class="calibre2">, it’s time to admit your behavior is damaging and get a grip on your situation.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">You’re reading this book because you want to improve your money situation&mdash; perhaps even get rich&mdash;and the</em> only way <em class="calibre2">to tread that path is to get out of credit card debt. Here’s how.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">FIRST, YOU NEED THE CASH FLOW</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">To eradicate debt, you need to have enough income every month to meet your regular obligations like groceries, utilities,
            your mortgage, and the minimum payments on your credit cards, plus enough to throw toward putting that debt away for good.
            If you do not have enough income to cover more than your minimum payments, you have to clear that hurdle by earning more money,
            negotiating with your credit card issuers to lower your minimum payments, or working with a legitimate, nonprofit debt consolidation
            organization that negotiates with creditors on your behalf, not one that provides you with a loan. Try the National Foundation
            for Credit Counseling at 
            <a href="http://www.nfcc.org">www.nfcc.org</a>. [Ramit says: ‘UK equivalents are the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (<a href="http://www.cccs.co.uk">www.cccs.co.uk</a>) and National Debtline (<a href="http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk">www.nationaldebtline.co.uk</a>).]</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEXT, PRIORITIZE YOUR CREDIT CARDS</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">The best way to do this is to list your debts from highest interest rate to lowest. If you do a little research, you may find
            some people&mdash;vocal professionals with motivational seminars and radio talk shows&mdash;who disagree with this premise. They want
            you to list your credit cards with the lowest balances as the most important, the ones to fully pay off first. They claim
            that the emotional “quick win” of paying off the first card as quickly as possible will motivate you to continue paying off
            debt. (This sounds more like a “quick win” for the credit card industry because they will get more of your money from interest.)
            You’re already motivated&mdash;and it could well be your emotions that got you into this mess of debt in the first place. Leave
            your emotions at the door and get out of debt the quickest, cheapest, and most efficient way possible.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">PAY THE MINIMUM ON EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE TOP CARD</small>. </strong> <em class="calibre2">Once your credit cards are ranked properly, pay the minimum amount due listed on the statement for every card except the one
            at the top of the list. Dedicate</em> all<em class="calibre2"> the extra funds you have to paying it off. Do this every month until that first credit card balance disappears. Then move
            to the second card on the list.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">STOP USING YOUR CARDS</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">When you’re paying off debt, you don’t want to be adding more at the same time. Eliminating debt is more than just paying
            off your balances, it’s also about resisting consumerist temptations. Don’t cancel your cards, but stop using them. Some people
            have found resisting the temptation to spend to be easier when the credit cards are out of sight. One creative method is to
            literally “freeze your credit”: Freeze your plastic into a block of ice as described at

      <p class="calibre6">Let me ask you a question. Right now, for every £100 you earn, how much of it goes to debt? Two pounds? Maybe £5? What if
         you paid £10 toward your debt? You’d be surprised that many people don’t even have to cut much spending to pay off debt quickly.
         They just have to stop spending on random items, get conscious about making debt a priority, and set up aggressive automatic
         transfers to pay off their credit card debt. I don’t want to make this sound easy, because paying off your credit card debt
         is extremely difficult. But millions of others have done it.

         because there isn’t one. If there were, I would be the first to tell you. But truthfully, paying off debt just takes hard
         work and a plan. It may seem like pure agony for the first few weeks, but imagine the relief you’ll feel when you see your
         debt growing smaller and smaller with each passing month. And sometime after that, you’ll be debt-free! Then you can focus
         all your energy on getting ahead, investing, and living your life. It may not happen overnight, but if you pay off your credit
         card debt as aggressively as possible, you’ll soon be on the road to getting rich and staying rich.

      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5. Get started.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Within the coming week, you should start paying more money toward your debt. If you find yourself taking more time than that
         to get started, you’re overthinking it. Remember the philosophy behind the 85 Percent Solution: The goal is not to research
         every last corner to decide where the money will come from, it’s action. Figure out how much debt you have, decide how you
         want to pay it down, negotiate your rates, and get started. You can always fine-tune your plan and amount later.

      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">My biggest mistake was not thinking about the future, and using credit cards to live beyond my means. I got myself into debt
            in my mid-twenties by spending, spending, spending&mdash;and on stupid things like clothes, eating out, DVDs, etc. Once I allowed
            myself to carry a balance that first time, it got easier to let it build up. I learned my lesson, and am now living within
            my means on a strict budget that will allow me to be debt-free in two years. Being in debt means giving up choices, means
            staying at a job you hate because it pays good money, means not being able to build a decent savings account. On a happier
            note, all of my debt is now on cards with APRs between 0 and 4.99 percent. I have a small but growing savings account, a pension,
            and a plan to achieve financial freedom.</em></p>

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">How Banks Rake It In</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">F</span>undamentally, banks earn money by lending the money you deposit to other people. For example, if you deposit £1,000, a Big
         Bank will pay you 0.5 percent to hold on to that money, and then they’ll turn around and lend it out at 7 percent for a home
         loan. Assuming that everyone repays the full amount they’re loaned, the bank makes a fourteen-times return on their money
         for simple arbitrage. (To be fair, banks don’t get 100 percent of their principal plus interest back, so they do incur some
         risk and should be compensated accordingly. But fourteen times is a lot of money.) To me, this is a lot like a lazy Godzilla
         outsourcing a city’s destruction to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man while he sits around and eats a big old pizza, then takes
         a nap.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">FEES, FEES, FEES</small>.</strong> Banks also make money from fees&mdash;a lot of money. In 2006, banks made more than $10 billion from overdraft fees alone. For
         example, if you’re using a debit card and accidentally buy something for more money than you have in your current account,
         you could end up paying a lot in charges. Your bank may charge you £30 if it lets the sale go through (because now you’re
         overdrawn) or a similar fee if it rejects the transaction. You could be hit by several charges plus a monthly overdraft fee
         (which varies). But there are some positives! Bank of America is nice enough to charge you only $20 for the first overdraft
         (but $35 for each subsequent overdraft). What a great deal! Check out Bank of America’s ridiculous “fees and processes” site,
         which offers FULL-SCREEN VIDEO and thousands of words but, crucially, does not actually tell you the amount they charge.

      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NO MORE OVERDRAFTS</small>.</strong> One overdraft fee at your crappy neighborhood bank wipes out your interest for the entire year and makes you hate your bank
         even more than you already do, if that’s even possible. More than half the people I’ve spoken to during my personal-finance
         talks have had at least one overdraft. One night back in college, I was out for dinner and my friend “Elizabeth” started asking
         me questions about overdrafts. They got increasingly complex, which weirded me out because I wondered how she knew so much
         about them. (I thought I was the only nerd who read up on overdraft fees for fun.) Then I asked her a simple question: “How
         many overdrafts have you had?” She suddenly got quiet, which forced me to interrogate her like Mike Wallace. I ended up learning
         that she’d incurred more than $400 in overdraft fees over four years of college by simply not paying attention to how much
         money she had in her account. I screamed at her so much. The sad thing is that she could have negotiated her way out of the
       first few and then set up a system so that it never happened again. For more on negotiating bank fees, see <a href="#calibre_link-4">page 65</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Remember, your bank’s fees are often more important than the interest rate it offers: If you have £1,000 and another bank
         has a 1 percent higher interest rate, that’s a difference of £10 per year. <em class="calibre2">Just one</em> overdraft fee equals three times that amount. Costs matter.
      </p>
</div>

      <p class="calibre6">The UK current account market is a very competitive one. It means you should be able to track down an account that won’t insist
         that you pay in hundreds of pounds each month and that won’t charge you a monthly fee, but will pay you interest on your current
         account balance and give you a low or fee-free overdraft. The overdraft is normally limited to a couple of hundred pounds
         (and you shouldn’t need to use it) but it’s good to know you won’t be whacked with fees if you do go into the red.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The banks are constantly dreaming up new offers. My advice is to look for an account that consistently pays a reasonable interest
         rate on credit balances and where the bank gets a high rating for its customer service. Check the interest rates on the bank’s
         easy access savings accounts as well. If you bank online, you can easily transfer money from your current to your savings
         account (and vice versa).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Steer clear of packaged accounts (that charge a monthly fee of £8-£12 in return for extras such as travel insurance) unless
         you’re absolutely sure you’ll save money by taking one. Generally, the banks have a tendency to exaggerate how much the benefits
         are worth.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When interest rates are so low, it may be hard to get excited about how much your savings will earn, but if you put a bit
         of effort into choosing your bank at the outset, you’ll have done the hard work.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re worried about security, remember that the first £50,000 of your savings (per individual, not per account) is covered
         by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It’s an independent safety net if a bank or building society fails. Be aware
         that currently, the £50,000 limit applies to each banking licence. Some banks that are members of the same group (such as
         Halifax, Birmingham Midshires and Bank of Scotland), share a banking licence; others don’t. The financial regulator, the FSA,
         is looking to simplify the compensation rules, but as I write this, it hasn’t changed them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Banks that are based in Europe (strictly, it’s the European Economic Area, not just the EU), may be covered by the country’s
         own compensation scheme. In some cases, the limits are lower, in others, they’re higher. Check out the details at the FSCS
         website (<a href="http://www.fscs.org.uk">www.fscs.org.uk</a>).
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Nuts and Bolts</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow that I’ve got my bank rants out of the way, let’s go over a few account basics. You may think you know all this stuff (and
         a lot of it you probably do), but bear with me.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">CURRENT ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">As you know, current accounts let you deposit money and withdraw money using debit cards, checks, and online transfers. I
         think of my current account like an e-mail inbox: All my money goes in my current account, and then I regularly filter it
         out to appropriate accounts, like savings and investing, using automatic transfers. I pay most of my bills through my credit
         card, but occasionally there are bills that I can’t pay with my card&mdash;like rent or my car payment&mdash;that I pay directly from
         my current account using automatic transfers. (In <a href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter 5</a>, I’ll show you how to make these transfers and bill paying work
         automatically.) Traditionally, banks paid no interest on current accounts, but this is changing. Most online banks now offer
         current accounts with interest, blurring the line between current and savings accounts. Current accounts are the number one
         place where unnecessary fees are levied, which we’re going to fix (see <a href="#calibre_link-4">p.65</a>).

         </tr>
      </table>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Think of savings accounts as places for short-term (one month) to mid-term savings (five years). You want to use your savings
         account to save up for things like a vacation, Christmas gifts, or even longer-term items like a wedding or down payment on
         a house. The key difference between current accounts and savings accounts is this: Savings accounts pay interest (although,
         as we saw, the lines are being blurred with new interest-bearing current accounts). Some high street banks pay 0 percent interest
         on savings accounts, meaning that if you put £1,000 in a savings account, you’d earn £0.08 in monthly interest, or £1 per
         year. I’d expect to find more than that on the pavement each morning, so I’m not very impressed by that kind of return. Interestingly,
         if your money were sitting in one of those accounts, you’d actually be losing money every day because inflation is over 2
         percent. That’s right: You may be earning 0.1 percent interest on your savings account, but you’re losing 2.4 percent every
         year in terms of real purchasing power.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The most important practical difference between current accounts and savings accounts is that you withdraw money regularly
         from your current account&mdash;but you rarely withdraw from your savings account (or at least that’s the way it should be). Current
         accounts are built for frequent withdrawals: They have debit cards and ATMs for your convenience. But your savings account
         is really a “goals” account, where every pound is assigned to a specific item you’re saving up for.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most people keep their savings account and current account at the same bank, although this is increasingly changing as electronic
         transfers become the industry standard. In fact, with electronic transfers and online banks, options have gotten considerably
         better for consumers. Banks generally pay a higher interest rate for online savings accounts&mdash;currently 2 to 3 percent, which
         would produce £20 to £30 interest per year on that £1,000, compared with as little as £1 per year on a branch-based savings
         account. And as with any savings account, your money just keeps growing and compounding, meaning it is working for you by
         just sitting there.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">There is one downside to having an online savings account: It can take a few business days to access your money. Typically,
         if you want to withdraw your money, you’ll log in to your online savings account, initiate a free transfer to your current
         account, and then wait three to five days for it to happen. If you need your money immediately, this could cause a problem&mdash;but
         then again, you shouldn’t be withdrawing very frequently from your savings account, so most likely this won’t be a big issue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To see how much you’d make from an online account versus a branch-based one, plug in your own numbers using the online spreadsheet
         at my website, 
         <a href="http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com">iwillteachyoutoberich.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHY YOU NEED BOTH A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND A CURRENT ACCOUNT</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Having your money in two separate accounts makes money management easy. One basic way of looking at it is that your savings
         account is where you deposit money, whereas your current account is where you withdraw money. Yet there’s something profoundly
         different about having two accounts: If your friends want to go out on Friday night, you’re not going to say, “Hold on, guys,
         I need three business days to transfer money to my current account.” If you don’t have the money available in your discretionary
         (current) account because you’ve spent your “going out” money, you’re staying in that night. Having a separate savings account
         forces you to keep your long-term goals in mind instead of just blowing them off to have a few rounds of drinks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Right now, you might be saying to yourself, “Why should I bother with a savings account? I only have £300.” I hear this all
         the time. It’s true, the interest you’ll be earning on that kind of money isn’t really that much. But it’s not just about your immediate earnings&mdash;being young is about developing the right habits. We’re cutting our teeth with small amounts of money, but as our savings accounts increase from £5,000 and £10,000 to £100,000 to £1 million, the habits really start to matter. Start small now so that when you <em class="calibre2">do</em> have a lot of money, you’ll know what to do with it.
      </p>
            <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">How My Bank Accounts Work</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s not easy being me. Just as the paparazzi follow Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, wanting to know what they’re wearing and
         which clubs they’re going to, people are always dying to know about my personal-finance infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY ACCOUNTS</small>.</strong> All of my money goes through my interest-bearing Schwab online checking account. Deposits happen through direct deposit and
         by mailing checks in preaddressed, prestamped Schwab envelopes. I have a brick-and-mortar Wells Fargo checking account because
         it was required to open my savings account and I haven’t gotten around to closing it. But in general, once you’ve opened the
         online account, you can close your brick-and-mortar account any time.
      </p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY SYSTEM</small>.</strong> My finances work on a monthly cycle, and my system automatically disburses money where it needs to go. I’ve set up accounts
         to draw from my checking account. For example, my ING Direct savings account automatically withdraws a certain amount every
         month from my checking account, as does my investment account (more about these in <a href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter 3</a>). For consumer protection, I
         pay my bills using my credit card. The credit card is automatically paid in full every month by my online checking account.
         For cash expenses, I use the Schwab ATM card to withdraw money at any ATM nationwide. All ATM charges are fully reimbursed
         at the end of the month. Generally, I use my ING Direct account as a receiver, not a sender: I rarely transfer money out of
         there unless I need to cover a temporary shortage in my checking account or want to spend savings money on something important,
         like a vacation or birthday gift.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">And that’s how I do it.</p>
</div>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">FINDING THE PERFECT ACCOUNT SETUP</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I wish I could suggest the one best current and savings account for everyone, but each person is different. (That doesn’t
         mean I’m going to cop out and hold back my bank recommendations. I’ll give you my favorite accounts in a few pages.) Before
         you go about finding the specific banks and accounts you want to use, take a minute to consider the bigger picture of how
         you want to organize your accounts. I’ll take you through simple and advanced setups for your current and savings accounts,
         but pick the one that works well with your personality. You have to know yourself: Do you value simplicity? Or are you the
         kind of person who wants to spend your time building a complicated system for a slightly larger payout? For most people, the
         second option&mdash;“basic option + small optimization”&mdash;is perfect.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Most basic option (good for lazy people).</em></strong> This is the bare minimum. All you need is a current account and a savings account at any local bank. Even if you already
         have these accounts, it’s worth talking to your bank to be sure you’re not paying fees.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Basic option + small optimization (recommended for most people).</em></strong> This option means opening accounts at two separate institutions. Go for a current account that doesn’t charge a fee (avoid
         packaged accounts) and a high-yield online savings account. Whether it’s a branch-based current account, one that offers telephone
         banking or an online account, the main thing is that you don’t pay unnecessary fees. With the current account, you’ll have
         immediate access to your money and the ability to transfer cash to your high-interest online savings account for free. If
         you already have this, great! Just call to make sure you’re not paying unnecessary fees.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Advanced setup + full optimization (perfect for people who read things like 
               <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">lifehacker.com</a> and</em> The 4-Hour Workweek<em class="calibre2">).</em></strong> This setup consists of several current accounts and savings accounts at different banks, usually to eke out the most interest
         and services that various banks have to offer. For example, I have a basic checking account at a brick-and-mortar bank, an
         interest-bearing checking account at an online bank, and a savings account at yet another online bank. Although you can set
         up automatic online transfers, having multiple banks means multiple websites, multiple customer-service numbers, and multiple
         passwords. Some people find this overly complicated&mdash;if you’re one of them, stick to one of the more basic setups, unless it’s
         very important to you to fully optimize your bank accounts.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SO MANY CHOICES, SO LITTLE TIME</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Depending on what accounts you already have and what setup you’ve opted to go with, getting this part of your financial infrastructure
         squared away may be as easy as making small changes to accounts you’ve had for a while. Or you may need to open new accounts,
         which can be pretty overwhelming. Imagine walking into a strip club in Vegas where you can see everyone lined up and take
         your pick. I am really hesitant to go further into this analogy because my mom is going to read this book, but suffice it
         to say that both strippers and banks want your money. Also, there are a lot of choices. That’s all, Mom!!!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As usual with financial decisions, we have too many options, leading most of us to make less-than-ideal choices&mdash;like opening
         a bank account in college and then staying with that bank forever. There are some good accounts out there, but of course banks
         don’t always make these deals easy to find.
      </p>

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Why Use a Building Society Over a Bank?</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you prefer, you could look at accounts offered by building societies. Unlike banks, they’re owned by their members. They
         don’t have shareholders to answer to or to take a slice of the profits. As a result they can provide better rates and a more
         personalised service than other high street banks. But don’t assume all building societies are the same or that they’ll automatically
         give you the best rate. Do your own research first.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">If you’re looking to save or borrow a small amount of money, you could find out if there’s a credit union near you (or your
         place of work). I’m a big fan of credit unions, which are small not-for-profit community saving and lending institutions.
         They don’t normally offer bank accounts, but will let you build up savings and can be a lifeline to people with a bad credit
         history who need a loan.
      </p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">Most traditional banks offer different current and savings accounts to serve customers with different needs and amounts of
         money. They start with basic accounts, for those who have a bad credit record. These accounts don’t let you go overdrawn.
         Next come student accounts, which normally offer an interest-free overdraft and sometimes a low-limit credit card. Standard
         current accounts should let you bank free of charge; let you pay bills by direct debit or standing order, withdraw money from
         cash machines and&mdash;depending on the bank&mdash;will let you bank online or by phone as well. Packaged accounts&mdash;which charge a monthly
         fee&mdash;are aimed at the higher end market and impose a minimum earning threshold (which can be £50,000 a year plus) or insist
         you deposit a certain amount each month. They offer benefits ranging from lower loan, overdraft rates and free travel insurance
         to discounted will-writing, reduced price concert tickets etc. These accounts are worthless. Avoid them. If you have that
       much money lying around, I’ll show you how to put it to work in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 7</a> and earn more than any bank could give you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You should research the options at a few different banks. I suggest calling (or even going in) and asking them if they can
         help you find a no-fee, no-minimum account. Ideally they’ll be able to offer you a few options. Remember, even if the accounts
         have fees or minimums, ask about ways (like direct deposit) to get them waived. Here are some websites to get you started:

         convenience, and features.

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Five Shiny Marketing Tactics Banks Use to Trick You</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1. Teaser rates</strong> (“6 percent for the first two months!”). Your first two months don’t matter. You want to pick a good bank that you can stick
         with for years&mdash;one that offers overall great service, not a promo rate that will earn you only £25 (or, more likely, £3).
         Banks that offer teaser rates are, by definition, to be avoided.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2. Requiring minimum balances</strong> to get better interest rates on credit balances and fee-free overdrafts.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">3. Up-sells</strong> to expensive accounts (“Expedited customer service! Wow!”). Most of these “value-added accounts” are designed to charge you
         for worthless services.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">4. Offering you a packaged account at an introductory rate.</strong> The current account market is a competitive one. Banks will try and entice you into a fee charging account with a ‘fee free’
         offer for the first few months. Avoid this. You don’t want to change current accounts every few months as it will damage your
         credit score.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">5. Bundling a credit card</strong> with your bank account. If you didn’t walk in specifically wanting the bank credit card, don’t get it.
      </p>

         high-interest accounts online. Perhaps it’s because Big Banks pay a meager 0.5 percent interest, and they try to nickel-and-dime
         us for every small service. Perhaps it’s because they secretly insert fees, like the charges for using another ATM, then count
         on our inaction to make money off us. There are still some good banks out there, though. The best way to find one is to ask
         friends if they have a bank they love. You should also browse the major bank websites. Within about five minutes, you should
         be able to tell which banks are trustworthy and which are not by seeing how straightforward they are with their accounts and
         fees. Your bank shouldn’t nickel-and-dime you through minimums and fees. It should have a website with clear descriptions
         of different services, an easy setup process, and 24/7 customer service available by phone. Another thing: Ask them if they
         send you promotional material every damn week. I don’t want more junk mail! Stop sending crap! A couple of years ago, I switched
         my car insurance because they would not stop sending me mail three times a week.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Convenience.</em></strong> If your bank isn’t convenient, it doesn’t matter how much interest you’re earning&mdash;you’re not going to use it. Since a bank
         is the first line of defense in managing your money, it needs to be easy to put money in, get money out, and transfer money
         around. This means its website has to work, and you need to be able to get help when you need it&mdash;whether by e-mail or phone.
      </p>

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Don’t Be a Rate Chaser</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">D</span>o me a favor: If your bank account offers 3 percent and another bank starts offering 3.1 percent, don’t change accounts. Half
         the time, those rates are simply introductory teaser rates that will drop after six months. I’d rather take a slightly lower
         interest rate if it’s at a bank I can trust to give me great service over the long term. But there are a lot of dorks who
         spend every waking hour online digging up the best interest rate and switching to it immediately. “OMG!!!!” they say. “Emigrant
         Direct increased its rate from 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent!! Now it’s 0.02 percent higher than ING Direct! I must switch
         accounts right away!! Onward!!!” If you do this, you are a moron. Do you really want to spend each month figuring out which
         bank is offering a slightly better rate? That’s a colossal waste of time for most of us, since a 0.5 percent difference equals
         just a few pounds per month more in interest. Plus, interest rates change over time, so rate chasing doesn’t even make sense.
         I plan on sticking with my bank for the next few <em class="calibre2">decades,</em> and I’m sure you have better things to do with your time. So focus on the big problems, not on rate jumping.
      </p>
</div>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">My bank’s website is TERRIBLE. It’s horrible&mdash;most of it isn’t in plain English, and they seem to think that everyone should
            speak like a stock trader. Even worse, it obfuscates how much you actually have versus how much you owe, and doesn’t give
            you streamlined access to moving things around. For example, on a recent charge I made, I can see it online but I can’t pay
            it. I will have to call them and authorize them to pay it. How messed up is that?</em></p>
      <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre7">&mdash;<small class="calibre10">ELEANOR P., 25</small>,</strong></p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Features.</em></strong> The bank’s interest rate should be competitive. If it’s an online account, the bank’s website should be customer friendly,
         so it’s easy to navigate and doesn’t crash all the time. You should be able to transfer money between your accounts (whether
         they’re with the same bank or not) quickly and easily. It’s nice if the bank lets you categorize your spending and get images
         of canceled checks, but these aren’t necessary.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Best Accounts</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s we’ve seen, there’s a lot that goes into finding the right accounts. Here are a few specific options that I’ve found work
         well for many people:
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">CURRENT ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Your local bank or building society’s current account with no fees and no minimums</em></strong> . As I explained earlier, you can get a fee-free account that doesn’t require a minimum amount to be paid in. You should
         be able to pay all your bills by direct debit or standing order, free of charge. You can also transfer money and take cash
         out of ATMs without paying a penny (although some cash machines do charge). These accounts pay little or no interest, but
         because you won’t be storing much money here, that’s no big deal. Using the criteria I laid out on the last few pages, you
         should be able to find a bank or building society that you’ll be happy with.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I would not encourage anyone to use a standard branch-based savings account. Online savings accounts let you earn dramatically
         more interest with lower hassle. And because you’ll primarily be sending money there, not withdrawing it, what does it matter
         if it takes a few days to get your money?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">However, even though online accounts are generally a much better deal, there’s still quite a difference between the best and
         the worst. While there’s no point spending hours chasing every penny, a bit of time researching what’s on offer before you
         open your account is well worth it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">My tip? Go for an account that’s consistently paying a competitive rate of interest. Lots of savings accounts (whether they’re
         offered by the high street banks or by online providers) have sneaky terms and conditions which mean the headline-grabbing
         rate they offer to entice customers in, disappears after a few months.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Others come up with an account offering a great rate of interest (long enough for it to get in the ‘best buy’ tables in the
         papers and online) and then drop the rate without warning. The money information service Moneyfacts (<a href="http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk">www.moneyfacts.co.uk</a>) regularly looks into which accounts consistently pay a decent rate of interest and which are flash in the pan (look for
         the tab ‘consistent savings’ onsite). This is what it found in April 09: Over 18 months ICICI Bank’s HiSave account was the
         most consistent, followed by two building societies (Yorkshire and Principality) and Sainsbury’s bank Internet Saver account
         also made it into the top five. Over a longer period of time (three years), Sainsbury’s bank Internet Saver account was the
         most consistent, while Nationwide building society’s e-Savings account was number two.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">CASH ISAS</strong></h2>
      <p class="calibre6">If you don’t already have a cash ISA, it’s worth opening one. Cash ISAs are simply tax-free savings accounts, which means
         that if you have an ordinary savings account instead of an ISA, you’re paying tax on the interest. It’s not often the taxman
         gives you an easy way to pay less tax, so you should take it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The really great thing about cash ISAs is that &ndash; not only is all the interest completely tax-free, but you don’t have to lock
         your money away. You can get hold of it any time you want. OK, maybe not last thing at night if the bank’s closed, but, unlike
         pensions (which I’ll talk about later), with a cash ISA you save tax and can get access to your money when it suits you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Before you rush to pay every last penny you own into a cash ISA, you should know that there are limits on how much you can
         save in one every year (that’s the tax year, running from April 6th to April 5th the following year). These limits change
         from time to time so it’s worth keeping a check on them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Don’t use your cash ISA account for regular expenses (such as holiday, car repair and so on). The reason is that once you’ve
         paid in the maximum allowed into your cash ISA, you can’t top it up if you take money out of it.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Optimizing Your Bank Accounts</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether they’re accounts you just opened or already had, you need to optimize your current and savings accounts. This means
         you shouldn’t be paying fees or minimums. The key to optimizing an account is talking to an actual customer-service rep, either
         in person or on the phone. Yes, nerds, you have to get out of your chair and either go over to the bank or pick up the telephone.
         For some reason, half my friends are afraid of talking to people on the phone and it ends up costing them lots of money. I
         have a friend who recently lost his bank password and, for security reasons, had to call the bank to prove who he was. He
         turned into a Stockholm Syndrome victim in front of my eyes, muttering, “It’s not that important. I’ll just wait until I go
         into the bank” over and over. He didn’t get his password for four months! What the hell is wrong with people? You may not
         like to talk on the phone, but most of the special deals I’ll show you how to get require talking to someone in person or
         on the phone. So suck it up.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">AVOIDING MONTHLY FEES</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Maybe I’m too demanding, but if I’m lending a bank my money to re-lend out, I don’t believe I should have to pay them additional
         fees. Think about it: If your Big Bank charges you a £5 monthly fee, that basically wipes out any interest you earn. This
         is why I’m fanatical about my savings and checking accounts having no fees of any kind, including monthly fees, overdraft
         fees, or setup fees. If you already have an account at a bank you like, but they’re charging a monthly fee, try to get them
         to waive it. They will often do this if you set up direct deposit, which lets your employer deposit your paycheck directly
         into your account every month.
      </p>
      
      <p class="boxh"><a id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre4"></a><strong class="calibre5">Alert to Students</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="di">If you’re a student, there’s no reason you shouldn’t have an account with no fees and no minimums. If you decide to stick
         with a Big Bank account, make sure you’re in a student account with no annual fees. Here’s how the conversation will probably
         go:
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Hi, I’m a student and I’d like to get a savings account and a current account with no annual fees. I’d like free checking
         and no minimum balance, please.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BANKER</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">I’m really sorry, but we don’t offer those anymore.</em></p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Really? That’s interesting because [HSBC/NatWest/other competitor] is offering me that exact deal right now. Could you check
         again and tell me which comparable accounts you offer?
      </p>
      <p class="btx1"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">(Eighty percent of the time, you’ll get a great account at this point. If not, ask for a supervisor.)</em></strong></p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">SUPERVISOR</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Hi, how can I help you?</em></p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> (Repeat argument from the beginning. If the supervisor doesn’t give you an option, add this:) Look, I’ve been a customer
         for X years and I want to find a way to make this work. Plus, I know that your customer-acquisition cost is more than two
         hundred dollars. What can you do to help me stay a customer?
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">SUPERVISOR</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">What an astounding coincidence. My computer is suddenly allowing me to offer the exact account you asked for!</em></p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOU</small>:</strong> Why, thank you, kind sir. (Sip Darjeeling tea.)
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">You’re in a customer group that’s very profitable for banks: ING Direct and the American Bankers Association put the cost
         of acquiring a new customer between $100 and $3,500&mdash;including all of their advertising, personnel, and technology costs. They
         don’t want to lose you over something as small as a $5 monthly fee. Use this knowledge as leverage whenever you contact any
         financial company.
      </p>
</div>

      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4"></a>Banks will also try to trick you by demanding “minimums,” which refer to minimum amounts you must have in your account to
         avoid fees or to get “free” services like bill pay. These are B.S. Imagine if a bank required you to keep £1,000 sitting in
         its low-interest account. You could be earning twenty times that much by investing it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you can’t do direct deposit because your job doesn’t offer it or if you can’t get the bank to waive a “minimum,” I strongly
         recommend that you switch to an online high-interest account, which has no fees and no minimums.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Note: Certain charges are okay for services like money orders and reordering checks. Please don’t run into your bank screaming,
         “BUT RAMIT TOLD ME NO FEES!!!!” when you’re trying to order more checks. That would be cool, though.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">ALMOST ALL BANK FEES ARE NEGOTIABLE</strong></h2>
      <p class="calibre6">The most painful and expensive fees are usually overdraft fees&mdash;which is the fee your bank charges you if you don’t have enough
         money in your current account to cover a purchase. Of course, the best way to avoid overdraft fees is to not let them happen
         in the first place. Set up automatic transfers and keep a cash cushion in your account (I keep about $1,000 in my checking
         at all times). But mistakes do happen. Most banks understand that people are occasionally forgetful and they’ll waive a first-time
         fee if you ask. After the first time, it gets harder but can still be done if you have a good excuse. Remember: They want
         to keep you as their customer. A well-executed phone call can often make a difference. But when calling, keep in mind that
         you should have a clear goal (to get your fee erased) and should not make it easy for companies to say no to you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Here’s how I negotiated my way out of a $20 overdraft fee and a $27.10 finance charge from Wells Fargo.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">I had transferred money from my savings account to my checking account to cover a temporary shortage, and the transfer arrived
         one day late. I saw the overdraft fee, sighed, and called the bank to get it waived.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">RAMIT</small>:</strong> Hi, I just saw this bank charge for overdrafting and I’d like to have it waived.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BANK REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">I see that fee… hmm… Let me just see here. Unfortunately, sir, we’re not able to waive that fee. It was [some B.S. excuse
            about how it’s not waiveable].</em></p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Bad Things to Say Here:</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">“Are you sure?”</em></p>
      <p class="ext3a">Don’t make it easy for the rep to say no to your request.</p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">“Is there anything else I can do?”</em></p>
      <p class="ext3a">Again, imagine if you were a customer-service rep and someone said this. It would make your life easier to just say no. As
         a customer, don’t make it easy for companies to say no.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">“Well, this Indian blogger dude told me I could.”</em></p>
      <p class="ext3a">Nobody cares. But it would be cool if a thousand customers called their banks and said this.</p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">“Okay.”</em></p>
      <p class="ext3a">Don’t give up here. Despite what you learned in sex ed, “no” does not mean “no” when it comes from a bank.</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Try this instead:</em></strong></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">RAMIT</small>:</strong> Well, I see the fee here and I’d really like to get it waived. What else can you do to help me? (Repeat your complaint and
         ask them how to constructively fix it.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">At this point, about 85 percent of people will get their fees refunded. I have hundreds of comments from people on my blog
         who have taken this advice and saved thousands of dollars in fees. But in case the rep is obstinate, here’s what you can do.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BANK REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">I’m sorry, sir, we can’t refund that fee.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">RAMIT</small>:</strong> I understand it’s difficult, but take a look at my history. I’ve been a customer for more than three years, and I’d like
         to keep the relationship going. Now, I’d like to get this waived&mdash;it was a mistake and it won’t happen again. What can you
         do to help?
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BANK REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Hmm, one second, please. I see that you’re a really good customer…. I’m going to check with my supervisor. Can you hold for
            a second?</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">(Being a long-term customer increases your value to them, which is one reason you want to pick a bank you can stick with for
         the long term. And the fact that you didn’t back down at the first “no” makes you different from 99 percent of other customers.)
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BANK REP</small>:</strong> <em class="calibre2">Sir, I was able to check with my supervisor and waive the fee. Is there anything else I can help you with today?</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s all I had to do! This doesn’t just work for overdraft fees&mdash;it can also work for certain processing fees, late fees,
         and even ATM fees. I learned this lesson the hard way. I lived in New York for a summer when I was doing an internship. I
         decided not to open a bank account while I was there because it would take time and I was lazy. So I just used those ATMs
         left and right and ate the $3 charges ($1.50 from my bank, $1.50 from the ATM) each time. Now I feel dumb because I just talked
         to a friend who recently moved to New York for a few months. She didn’t want to open a bank account for such a short time
         either, but instead of just shrugging and saying “Oh, well,” she actually called her bank. She just asked them if they would
         waive the ATM fees while she was there. “No problem,” they said. She saved more than $250 just by making a phone call! Remember,
         with a customer-acquisition cost of more than $200, banks want to keep you as their customer. So use this information to your
         advantage, and next time you see any fees levied on your account, make the call.
      </p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">While many bank fees are ridiculous, I find that they are quite willing to wipe them for a good customer. I had a bounced-check
            fee wiped because I stupidly wrote a check out of the wrong account. I simply walked into the bank and asked, and they did
            it right there on the spot. I didn’t have to do any convincing or anything. Plus, I’d been a customer for about five years.</em></p>

         immediately frowned. “Vijay, this is very good! But why did you get this A minus? What happened?” they said. As you can imagine,
         this approach tends to promote a slightly warped view of the world for Indian children. I can’t wait to do this to my future
         kids someday.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Perhaps the fact that I grew up with this worldview explains why, when people finally start thinking about their finances,
         I congratulate them for approximately six seconds before I secretly judge them because I know they’re not doing enough. In
         the last chapter we talked about saving, and I’m happy you’ve opened up a high-interest savings account. I really am. But
         it’s not enough! Saving a little money here and there is not enough, despite what you read in the myriad books and blogs filled
         with tips and tales of frugality. “Buy 200 cases of orange juice,” these fantastic articles say, “and you can save 6 percent!
         Amazing!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Get a life. The sad fact is, if you do only the bare minimum&mdash;for example, if you get frugal and save £100 a month in an online
         savings account&mdash;the results will not be especially impressive. Even if you’re earning a competitive 3 percent or higher from
         a high-interest online savings account, it will take you a long, long time to get a substantial return. You need a way to
         put that money to work for you so it earns more than even the highest-yielding savings account, and investing is the first
         and best way to do it. “Compounding,” Albert Einstein said, “is mankind’s greatest invention because it allows for the reliable,
         systematic accumulation of wealth.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Rather than earning 0.5 percent interest like most people do in their savings account, or even six times that amount with
         a high-interest savings account (like the one you now have, right?), you can earn around 5 percent per year over the long
         term by investing: Between 1899 and 2008 the average annual stock market return was 4.9 percent (with inflation taken off).
         To put that in perspective, if you invested £1,000 at age twenty-five and didn’t touch it until age sixty-five, it would be
         worth about £3,000 in your 3 percent high-interest savings account, but if you put it in an investment account that earned
         5 percent, you’d have more than £7,000.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Investing may seem intimidating, especially considering the volatility of the markets during the global financial crisis.
         But it’s actually quite painless. I’ll walk you through it, and by the end of this chapter, you’ll have opened an investment
         account. You don’t actually have to worry about choosing where to invest yet&mdash;that comes in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 7</a>. For now, we’ll set up
         the right accounts so that when you’re ready, you can simply set up automatic transfers to funnel cash there each month.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore we go any further, let’s take a minute to understand why young people are not investing. Then you can secretly scorn
         them once you’ve opened your own investment accounts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Ask any of your friends how much they’ve invested and they’ll say things like, “Huh?” or “I don’t earn enough to invest.”
         Most of them will say, “I don’t know how to pick stocks,” which is ironic because INVESTING ISN’T ABOUT PICKING STOCKS. Although
         it’s true that some of them might participate in a pension, through work or privately, that’s probably the extent of their
         investments. And yet these are the most important investing years of our lives!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Another reason young people don’t invest is that they’re scared. You can hear the media scream “Global financial crisis!”
         only so many times before you decide to opt out altogether. And yet, a drop in the stock market is a <em class="calibre2">good</em> thing for young people. It means investments are essentially on sale, so we can buy stocks for less now and then let our
         money grow for decades. When people say “buy low, sell high,” this is what they’re talking about.

      <p class="calibre6">Remember, knowing how to invest isn’t obvious. And that’s the problem. When it comes to money, it’s actually very easy to
         end up like most other people: You just… do nothing. After years of talking to young people about money, I have come to a
         couple of conclusions: First, I pretty much hate everyone. Second, I believe there are three categories of people: the As,
         the Bs, and the Cs. The As are already managing their money and want to optimize what they’re doing. The Bs, the largest group
         of people, are not doing anything but could be persuaded to change that if you figure out what motivates them. The Cs are
         an unwashed mass of people who are a lost cause. Theoretically, they <em class="calibre2">could</em> be motivated, but it’s impossibly hard to get through their knuckleheaded reasons and excuses for putting money management
         so far down their list of priorities.

            want a boring office job. I don’t think he’s ever received more than $9 an hour in his life. He has spent all of his money
            on lighter bike parts and VHS movies. When DVDs came out, he started rebuying the same movies on DVD because they were “better
            quality.” Meanwhile, he filed for bankruptcy to get out from under credit card debt and now lives in a trailer behind his

      <p class="calibre6">Sadly, although some people are limited by circumstances, most people will never get rich simply because they have poor attitudes
         and behaviors about money. In fact, most people in their twenties are Bs: not great, but not bad. There’s a lot of time left
         for them to set aggressive investment goals, but if they don’t take any action, they end up inevitably drifting toward being
         a C. Don’t let this happen to you!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Why do so many of us have such poor attitudes toward money? You could make a convincing case for a lack of education, too
         much information, confusing messages from the media, or simply a lack of interest. Whatever the reason, we <em class="calibre2">know</em> young people aren’t investing enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Financial institutions have noticed an interesting phenomenon: When people enter their forties, they suddenly realize that
         they should have been saving money all along. As a result, the number one financial concern Americans have is not having enough
         money for retirement. “Even a majority of Americans in upper-income households say they are ‘very’ or ‘moderately’ worried
         about their retirement income,” says Lydia Saad of the Gallup News Service. To bring this close to home, ask your parents
         what they worry about most. I’ll bet you their answer is, simply, “money.” Yet we’re not paying much more attention to our
         finances than our parents did.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Although it’s easy to “plan” on winning the lottery to get rich, the real way to do it is actually much simpler: Of America’s
         millionaires, 80 percent are first-generation affluent, meaning their parents weren’t rich. They collected their significant
         wealth through controlling their spending, regular investing, and in some cases, entrepreneurship. Not as sexy as winning
         the lottery, but much more realistic.

      <p class="calibre6">On average, millionaires invest 20 percent of their household income each year. Their wealth isn’t measured by the amount
         they make each year, but by how much they’ve saved and invested over time. In other words, a project manager could earn £50,000
         per year and be richer than a doctor earning £250,000 per year&mdash;<em class="calibre2">if</em> the project manager has a higher net worth by saving and investing more over time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">American culture doesn’t help us think about investing our money. We see shows like <em class="calibre2">My Super Sweet 16</em> that show us the <em class="calibre2">results</em> of being rich, not <em class="calibre2">how to get there.</em> Not surprisingly, as such TV shows have become more popular, our attitudes have changed. According to a Roper Center study
         in 1975, a lot of Americans thought “the good life” meant a happy marriage, one or more children, an interesting job, and
         a home. By 1999, the responses were more materialistic: “a lot of money,” a second car,” “a second TV,” “a vacation home,”
         “a swimming pool,” and “really nice clothes.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Despite this preoccupation with material goods and a dizzying array of information sources&mdash;including 24/7 financial-news channels
         and dozens of personal-finance magazines&mdash;most of us don’t seem to be concerned with managing our financial situation. Even
         high-income earners don’t handle their money well: 34 percent of those who earned $250,000 or more said the need to pay everyday
         bills was the top reason why they weren’t saving more. One in ten said they weren’t making enough to make ends meet, according
         to an HSBC Bank report in 2007.

      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-50"></a>Even though lots of young people have naive and often delusional ideas about money, you don’t need to be one of them. I’m

         from now&mdash;you’ll see an investment account full of money that is automatically added to each month. You’ll be earning while

      <p class="p">By opening an investment account, you give yourself access to the biggest moneymaking vehicle in the history of the world:
         the stock market. Setting up an account is an excellent first step toward actually investing, and you don’t have to be rich
         to open one. Many account providers will reduce minimum investment levels (depending on the investment you take out) to as
         little as £20 if you make regular monthly payments (more on this in <a href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter 5</a>).

      <h1 class="calibre11">Mastering Your Pension</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is a universally acknowledged truth that girls named Nancy are never hot. But imagine that you met the hottest Nancy of
         your life on spring break in Cabo. Would you be willing to challenge your deep-seated worldview and hang out with her?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s the trade-off you make with a pension: uncool name, kinda boring, but huge… benefits. Here’s how they work:</p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re employed, you’ll normally be offered the chance to join a work-based pension. Different employers have different
         schemes and some have more than one type. The main thing to find out is whether the employer is going to pay into it or not.
         If they do, it’s generally a no-brainer. It’s not often your boss gives you something for free, so why would you turn this
         down?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Whatever type of pension your employer offers (and I’ll talk about these in more detail later), what you need to understand
         is that it’s simply a retirement account that gives you large tax advantages if you agree not to withdraw money until you
         reach retirement age (the earliest age you can withdraw money is 50, rising to 55 in April 2010). Depending on the type of
         pension you’re paying into, you may not have to take any money out of it until you’re 75. (But don’t worry about that now.
         By the time you’re 75, we’ll all have flying jet packs and robots to handle all our finances.) To set up your pension, you
         fill out a form authorizing part of your paycheck&mdash;you decide how much&mdash;to be sent to your account each month. The money goes
         straight from your employer to your pension, so you never see it in your paycheck. When you set the account up, you choose
         among some simple investment options, then let your money accumulate over time.
      </p>

      <p class="source1">Defined-benefit plans are useful if your employer matches above 15%.</p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s dig deeper into the benefits of your pension.</p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Pension Benefit 1: Using Pretax Money Means an Instant 25 Percent Accelerator:</em></strong> Retirement accounts offer you a deal: You promise to invest your money for the long term, and in exchange they give you huge
         tax advantages. Because the money you’re contributing isn’t taxed until you withdraw it many years later (this is called “pretax
         money”), you have much more money to invest for compound growth&mdash;usually 25 to 40 percent more (although this could change
         for some higher earners in 2010).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s look at a regular investment account first (we’ll ignore stocks and shares ISAs for now). If you open one of these at
         any investment firm, you don’t get many tax advantages: For every £100 you make, you’ll be able to invest only about £75 of
         it because, depending on your tax rate, about 25 percent goes to pay income taxes.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">A pension is different. It’s “tax-deferred,” meaning you can invest the entire £100 and let it grow for about thirty-plus
         years. Sure, you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw your money later, but that extra 25 percent turns out to make a huge difference
         as it gets compounded more and more.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Pension Benefit 2: Your Employer Match Means Free Money:</em></strong> In many cases, your employer will match part of your contribution, meaning you get automatic free money for investing&mdash;a win-win
         situation. To find out if your company offers a pension match, just ask your HR rep what the matching policy is.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">How exactly does matching work? Here’s an example: Again say your company offers a 100% match up to 4 percent. This means
         your company will match every pound you invest up to 4 percent of your salary. For easy math, let’s pretend you make £50,000
         per year. You contribute £2,000 (4 percent of your salary) each year. Your employer then matches the £2,000, so your actual
         investment is £4,000 per year.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you start at age twenty-five and earn 7 percent on your money, you’ll have more than £638,000 with a company pension with
         a 100% match. And each year you invest, the difference grows larger.

         it. This is an excellent example of using psychology to trick yourself into investing. In fact, there’s an emerging body of
         literature on how powerful these effects are.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Research for the Department for Work and Pensions showed that, whereas only 41 percent joined a scheme on an “opt-in” basis,
         that rose to 60 percent when employees were automatically enrolled. Sure, you’re given the freedom to opt out, but automatic
         enrolment takes advantage of the fact that most people don’t do anything active with their money. That’s why a new pension,
         which is due to be introduced in 2012, called the personal account, would&mdash;for the first time&mdash;use automatic (or auto) enrolment
         to encourage people to save for their retirement.

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">COMMON CONCERNS ABOUT PENSIONS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">What happens if I really need my money?</em></strong> A company pension is a retirement account for long-term investments, not a current or savings account that you can dip in
         and out of it as you wish. Your company scheme may not allow you to take your pension early (before the normal retirement
         age of the scheme, which may be 60 or older). In any case, you cannot access your pension before the age of 50 (55 from April
         2010) although you may be able to cash it in and take it as a lump sum if you are seriously ill and have less than a year
         to live. The punishments are intentional: this is money for your retirement, not to go out drinking on Saturday. Remember,
         the biggest problem most people have is not saving and investing at all, so don’t let worrying about how you’ll get your money
         out stop you. Once you’ve saved and invested money, you can always figure out a way to withdraw it if you really need to.

      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Will I have to pay taxes when I withdraw my money?</em></strong> Yes. Although your pension is tax-deferred, it’s not tax-free: When you start withdrawing after age 50 (55 from 2010), you’ll
         have to pay taxes. But don’t feel bad about paying these taxes, since your money will have been compounding at an accelerated
         rate for the last thirty to forty years. Because you agreed to invest your money in a pension, you were able to put in about
         25 percent more money to grow for you.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">What if I switch jobs?</em></strong> The money in your pension is yours, so if you move to another company, don’t worry. You have a few options:
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">1. LEAVE IT AT YOUR CURRENT COMPANY</small>.</strong> This may be a good option if the benefits offered by the scheme are generous (for example if it’s a final salary pension
         and you’re moving to an employer who doesn’t offer this). The disadvantage is that you could end up with several pension pots
         and forget about them. Some defined contribution schemes have higher charges once you leave the company and you certainly
         won’t stay up to date on the investment options and changes offered through the plan.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">2. TRANSFER IT INTO YOUR NEW COMPANY’S PENSION SCHEME</small>.</strong> Depending on the type of pension you were paying into at your old employer and the type of pension that’s being offered by
         your new employer, you may be able to transfer your old pension to your new employer’s scheme. But that doesn’t necessarily
         mean it will be the best course of action. For example, if your old employer had a final salary pension scheme, it’s probably
         a bad idea. You should take advice before you make the switch; if the pension scheme you’re moving to has less generous benefits
         than the one you’re leaving or is a different type of pension scheme, you may be better off leaving your pension where it
         is.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">3. TRANSFER IT INTO A PERSONAL OR STAKEHOLDER PENSION</small>.</strong> This can be a good option if, for example, your current scheme has high charges or doesn’t offer you the investment flexibility
         you’d like, or if you have a final salary scheme and you’re worried that your employer may cease trading and may not be able
         to pay out the pension they’ve promised. Although there’s a protection scheme in place to compensate people who’ve signed
         up to occupational pensions where the pension scheme fails, there are limits on how much compensation you would receive. However,
         you should still take independent, professional advice. It’s certainly not always a good idea to transfer your pension from
         a company scheme into a personal or stakeholder pension (if you have a long enough memory, you might be able to think back
         to the pensions mis-selling scandal of the 1980s when thousands were advised to transfer out of company schemes into private
         pensions that gave them a fraction of the pension they would have otherwise received). Take independent advice before you
         go down this route.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SUMMARY OF EMPLOYER PENSION BENEFITS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">We’ve covered this, but it bears repeating: employer pensions are great because with virtually no effort on your part you
         get to put pretax money to work. What this means is that since you haven’t paid taxes on the money yet, there’s more of it
         to compound over time. On top of this, your company might offer a very lucrative pension match, which amounts to free money
         that you’d be insane not to take. If it’s a final salary scheme, you don’t even have to worry about how well the stock market
         performs&mdash;your pension will be based on your salary, not investment perfomance.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">DO IT NOW: SETTING UP YOUR COMPANY PENSION</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">How you become a member of your company pension will depend on the type of scheme it is. If it’s a final salary (sometimes
         called ‘defined benefit’) pension scheme, you just need to call your HR administrator and get the paperwork so that you can
         join the scheme. You won’t be given a choice of funds or contribution levels &ndash; so the only decision you have to make is whether
         or not to join in the first place.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If your employer offers a defined contribution pension scheme, find out how much your employer will contribute and how much
         you need to pay into the scheme in order for them to match you at maximum levels,
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If your employer has a group personal pension (GPP) or stakeholder scheme and contributes on your behalf, it’s normally worth
         joining. Money will be deducted from your paycheck every month, so you shouldn’t even notice it’s gone.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">PERSONAL AND STAKEHOLDER PENSIONS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you don’t have access to a pension scheme through your employer (or your employer has set up a group personal pension or
         stakeholder plan but doesn’t pay a penny into it) you can pay into your own pension plan. Don’t get too hung up on the jargon;
         stakeholders and personal pension plans are very similar, except that stakeholders have strict limits on how much the pension
         company can take every year in management fees and charges, they have to let you stop and start contributions or transfer
         to another scheme without charging any penalty and you can pay in as little as £20 a month.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You don’t even have to be working or earning a salary to take out a stakeholder (you can pay up to £3,600 year into one if
         you don’t have any earnings). As with company and employer-based pensions, you get tax relief on any money you pay into a
         personal or stakeholder pension.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SIPPS (AND WHY THEY’RE DIFFERENT)</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">There’s another kind of personal pension that you might be interested in. SIPPs (the name stands for “self invested personal
         pensions”) let you invest in all kinds of funds and investments that you wouldn’t be able to put your money into if you had
         an ordinary personal or stakeholder pension. Some employers offer SIPPs to their workers (but normally only to senior staff),
         but most SIPPs are taken out by individuals who aren’t happy simply to hand their money over to a pension company each month.
         They can be a good idea if you’re someone who wants to take more control over your pension, but probably not worth it if you’d
         rather “invest it and forget it”.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">What SIPPs let you do&mdash;that ordinary pensions don’t&mdash;is to get access to a very wide range of investments. If you’re someone
         who would like to take an active interest in where your pension money is invested, you can do that easily with a SIPP. And
         if you’d rather put a lot of your pension money into low-risk investments, such as bonds, you’re able to do that as well.
         The list of assets you can invest your pension contributions in through a SIPP includes: shares, investment trusts, commercial
         property and government bonds. But for many, it’s the fact that SIPPs let them change their investment strategy that’s one
         of the major attractions.
      </p>
      <p class="img1"><img src="images/00032.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="source1"><strong class="calibre7">Source: Scottish Widows’ Pensions Report 2009/You Gov</strong></p>
      <p class="calibre6">The other advantage is that if you’re interested in particular investments (such as climate change or ethical funds), you
         may be better off with a SIPP, because of the choice they offer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But&mdash;as with everything&mdash;there are downsides and they shouldn’t be overlooked. The main disadvantage of SIPPs is that they can
         have higher charges; sometimes significantly higher and that’s meant they’ve generally been bought by people who’ve already
         saved quite a lot of money into their pension fund (or those who plan to do so in the future).
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHY PEOPLE MISS OUT</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">As the chart above shows, people are far more likely to save if they are employed (which means they will normally be able
         to join their employer’s pension scheme). And if your workplace has a final salary scheme you’re almost three times more likely
         to sign up to it than to set up your own pension if you work for yourself. Don’t miss out because you don’t have a pension
         scheme ready and waiting for you to join, courtesy of your boss.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">EMPLOYER-BASED VS PERSONAL STAKEHOLDER PLANS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Okay, so here’s the confusing thing. You can take out a stakeholder pension directly with a pensions company or you can join
         one that’s been organised through your work (assuming you’re not self-employed). What’s the difference and which is better?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If your employer has a stakeholder pension at work and pays into it, you should definitely join it rather than setting up
         one of your own. Not only will you get free money but all the hard work will be done for you. Money will be taken straight
         from your salary. But if they’ve just set up a stakeholder pension but don’t pay a penny into it, it’s a tougher call. Then
         it’s down to you to do a bit of research into the stakeholder pension company your employer has chosen and whether you can
         find something better if you go it alone.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">PENSION RESTRICTIONS</strong></h2>
      <p class="calibre6">Unless you have a final salary pension, you’ve got to convert your pension fund into a regular monthly payment when you retire.
         For most people, that means buying an annuity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Annuities (I prefer to think of them as a monthly retirement income) get quite a bad press because a) people who’ve paid into
         a pension want to be able to spend their money how they want to once they retire and b) because the money you get every month
         from your pension depends on the annuity rate and at the moment, they’re pretty low.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Growth Vs. Access</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="q"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">I don’t want to lock my money up in a retirement account&mdash;I might need it soon. What should I do?</em></p>
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7">A:</strong> Saving in a pension (whether it’s through your employer’s scheme or your own private pension) does mean locking your money
         away until you’re at least 50 (55 from 2010). That’s why you get the generous tax breaks. If you’re really worried about getting
         hold of your money, you could invest in a stocks and shares ISA instead (or split your money). They’re also meant for long-term
         investing but have different tax breaks to pensions. The difference is you can cash them in at any time.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">If you need your money in fewer than five years, put it in a high-interest savings account. But don’t make the mistake of
         keeping your money in a savings account just because you’re too lazy to take the time to learn how to invest it. If you’d
         invested ten years ago, wouldn’t it feel good to have a lot more money right now? Well, the next best time to invest is today.
      </p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">That argument doesn’t really stack up because you do have some flexibility about when you buy your annuity (although there
         are some exceptions, you have to do it by the time you hit 75).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">All I’d add is that those who really struggle when they retire are people who’ve never bothered to start a pension, not those
         who’ve taken out a personal plan and had to buy an annuity when rates are low.

      <p class="p">Don’t put off opening a personal or stakeholder pension because you think it’s complicated or that it will take hours to do.
         It’s not and it won’t. You can do it online in 20&ndash;30 minutes. Get off your ass!
      </p>
      <p class="p">If you’re not sure whether you should take out a stakeholder pension you can look at the Financial Services Authority’s website
         where it’s got a ‘decision tree’ to help you make up your mind: 
         <a href="http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/tools/stakeholder_pensions/notes_index.html">http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/tools/ stakeholder_pensions/notes_index.html</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You can go to a financial adviser if you’d rather someone talked you through the options, but don’t ignore this decision because
         you don’t know which adviser to talk to or you don’t think you can afford their advice. Just by putting off starting your
         pension by a year or two, you’ll have to pay far more into it every month to get the same amount of money when you retire.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">With a stakeholder pension, you can transfer money between funds without penalty so it doesn’t matter if you decide to invest
         in one fund and then change your mind. The main thing is to get started.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">STOCKS AND SHARES ISAS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I’ve talked about the different types of pensions, but you don’t have to save in a pension to get money for your retirement.
         If you’re really worried about having your money locked up, perhaps because you know you’re going to take a break from work
         to have kids later on, you could invest in a stocks and shares ISA instead (but don’t do this if you’ll need the money in
         5 years or less).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">ISAs don’t get the same tax break as pensions, but they’re still pretty good if you’re looking to save tax. Unlike pensions,
         ISAs don’t give you a helping hand from tax relief on the money you pay in, but you don’t pay any extra tax when you cash
         in your ISA. Not a penny. What you do get is the chance to cash in your ISA whenever you want to, without paying a penalty
         (although if the stock market has just fallen through the floor, you could lose a chunk of money).
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">TAKING OUT AN ISA</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you know what you want, you can avoid paying the upfront (or initial) charges, which can be as much as 5.5% of the money
         you pay in. If you use a discount broker, you’ll be able to do that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">So how much can you put into your ISA? Well, because you get far more freedom about when you cash in your ISA (and there are
         no restrictions on what you spend the money on) they have much lower annual limits than pensions. At the moment, the maximum
         you can pay into a stocks and shares ISA is £7,200 a year (although that’s due to rise to £10,200) and whatever you may have
         saved into a cash ISA comes off that limit.

         the online interface easy to use? Will your account allow easy automatic investing? Most of them do, but it is important to
         find out beforehand.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">And that’s it. Yes, you could spend hundreds of hours doing a detailed comparison of the total number of funds offered, frequency
         of mailings, and alternative pension or ISA accounts available, but more is lost from indecision than bad decisions. As Benjamin
         Franklin said, “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.” And as Ramit Sethi said, “Let others debate minutiae&mdash;all
         you need to do is open a pension or ISA account at a discount brokerage. Sucka.”
      </p>
      <p class="nl2ab">Signing up to a pension or stocks and shares ISA shouldn’t take long. You may be able to do it online or you might have to

            a month is easy to commit to, and from there raising my monthly contribution by ten bucks is easy to justify. No minimum meant

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">CHOOSING YOUR FUNDS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">At the start of the chapter, I talked about company pension schemes and depending on the type of pension your employer offers,
         you may not have any choice about where your money is invested. If it’s a final salary scheme, you have to invest your money
         alongside everybody else’s. If you’re taking out any other type of pension (stakeholder or defined contribution scheme) or
         an ISA, you should be able to put your money into a cash-based or money market account while you work out what you want to
         do with it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Beware that pensions are normally set up so that if you don’t actively choose an investment fund at the start your money is
         paid straight into a default account. Default accounts vary widely between different schemes (if it’s an employer-sponsored
         plan) and different pension companies. To avoid going into the default fund, you should actively select to put your money
         in a cash-based fund (or in a cash account if it’s a stocks and shares ISA) and switch to a different fund or funds when you’re
         ready.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You don’t want to leave your money in cash or cash-based funds if you’re investing for your retirement (or at least for the
         long term), but if you’re paying money into your pension or ISA every month, then in the first few months you’ll won’t have
         much money in the account, so keeping it in cash won’t make much difference to your returns. We’ll cover the different investment
       options in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 7</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">BEYOND RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you’ve joined your employer’s pension scheme (paying as much as you need to get matching contributions, where relevant)
         or started your own personal or stakeholder scheme (or a stocks and shares ISA if you’re worried about being locked in), your
         next stage is to learn more about the choices to grow your money.

         between short-term savings and long-term investing. And that £50 you sent may seem like a small step, but I believe it’s the
         most significant £50 you’ll ever invest.

         leave on the bone. Some people leave half the chicken and move on to the next wing. These people are worthless, and I quickly
         distance myself from them. Then there are people who clean the bone so thoroughly, flawlessly ridding it of every last shred
         of meat and marrow, that you can conclude only two things: They will be stellar successes in all facets of life, and they
         must be from another country. You see, immigrants (like my parents) never leave a shred of meat on a chicken wing&mdash;we can all

      <p class="calibre6">That kind of economy is rare these days. (Although in the wake of the global financial crisis, frugality&mdash;or at least giving
         lip service to it&mdash; is becoming more common.) We spend more on our mobile phones than most people in other countries do on
         their mortgages. We buy shoes that cost more than our grandparents paid for their <em class="calibre2">cars</em>. Yet we don’t really know how much these individual costs add up to. How many times have you opened your bills, winced, then
         shrugged and said, “I guess I spent that much”? How often do you feel guilty about buying something&mdash;but then do it anyway?
         In this chapter, the antidote to unconscious spending, we’re going to gently create a new, simple way of spending. It’s time
         to stop wondering where all your money goes each month. I’m going to help you redirect it to the places <em class="calibre2">you</em> choose, like investing, saving, and even spending <em class="calibre2">more</em> on the things you love (but less on the things you don’t).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Wait! Before you run away thinking this is a chapter on creating a budget, hang on a second. This isn’t about creating a fancy
         budget that you’ll have to maintain every day for the rest of your life. I hate budgeting. <em class="calibre2">Budgeting</em> is the worst word in the history of the world. I could be sitting on a golden throne surrounded by forty-three scantily clad
         models, and if I accidentally uttered the word <em class="calibre2">budget,</em> I sincerely believe they would all instantaneously look up (from feeding me grapes and fanning me, duh), open their jaws
         in shock, and then flee in horror. Nobody wants to budget.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m not finished. “Create a budget!” is the sort of worthless advice that personal-finance pundits feel good prescribing,
         yet when real people read about making a budget, their eyes glaze over faster than John Goodman’s lips at Krispy Kreme. Who
         wants to track their spending? The few people who actually try it find that their budgets completely fail after two days because
         tracking every penny is overwhelming. Amusingly, in a 2007 survey by 
         <a href="http://www.bankrate.com">bankrate.com</a>, 75 percent of Americans said they have a budget&mdash;which is complete nonsense. “There’s probably a lot of wishful thinking
         in this response,” says Jared Bernstein, director of the Living Standards Program of the Economic Policy Institute. “It’s
         probably more accurate to say that three-quarters <em class="calibre2">think</em> they should work on a monthly budget.” My kind of man: exposing the delusions of people everywhere!
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">For the last fifty years, budgeting has been the battleground for snobby personal-finance writers who’ve tried to shove a
         daily tracking system down everyone’s throats because it sounds logical: “Track your spending! It’s so simple!” There’s only
         one catch: NOBODY EVER DOES IT.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">And I don’t believe for a second that because times are tough, Americans are going to buckle down and stop consuming over
         the long term. Most people wouldn’t know where to start if I told them to stop spending and start saving. I might as well
         try to convince an Ankylosaurus to dance a jig.

      <p class="calibre6">Let’s try something that actually works. Forget budgeting. Instead, let’s create a Conscious Spending Plan. What if you could
         make sure you were saving and investing enough money each month, and then use the rest of your money guilt-free for whatever
         you want? Well, you can&mdash;with some work. The only catch is that you have to plan where you want your money to go <em class="calibre2">ahead of time</em> (even if it’s on the back of a napkin). Would it be worth taking a couple of hours to get set up so you can spend on the
         things you love? It will automate your savings and investing, and make your spending decisions crystal clear. When your friends
         say, “I never have any money,” you’re going to wonder why they don’t just spend a couple of hours to set things up right&mdash;like
         you did.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Difference Between Cheap and Frugal</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span> while back, a couple of friends and I were talking about where we want to travel this year, and one of them said something
         that surprised me: “You probably wouldn’t approve, but I want to go to the Caribbean.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Huh? Why wouldn’t I approve?</p>
      <p class="calibre6">I stared at him pensively for many moments, taking the form of Rodin’s <em class="calibre2">Thinker</em> and wishing that I had a pipe and perhaps a tweed jacket. Then I figured it out. Apparently, he thought of me as a Finger-Wagging
         Money Judge, as if I silently disapproved of him for spending his money on something “frivolous.” In other words, someone
         who writes about personal finance is automatically “the guy who tells me I can’t do stuff because it costs too much money.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, I will call your ass out when you make mistakes (like one of my readers who
         wasn’t worried about his cable bill increasing $5/month, yet complained every time the price of gas went up two cents a gallon).
         But I’m <em class="calibre2">not</em> the nagging parent who tells you not to spend money on lattes. I spend lots of money on eating out and traveling, but I never
         feel guilty. Instead of taking a simplistic “Don’t spend money on expensive things!!!” view, I believe there’s a more nuanced
         approach to spending.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s first dispense with the idea that saying no to spending on certain things means you’re cheap. If you decide that spending
         £2.50 on Cokes when you eat out isn’t worth it&mdash;and you’d rather save that £15 each week for a movie&mdash;that’s not cheap. That’s
         using frugality to drive conscious spending. Unfortunately, most Americans dismiss frugality because they confuse it with
         cheapness, thinking that frugality is all-or-nothing: “Frugal people don’t spend money on anything! I’m never going to cut
         all my spending, so forget it.” Furthermore, our parents never taught us how to be frugal, so not only have we confused frugality
         with cheapness, but we never really practiced it in the first place. As a country, we spend more than we make each year and
         virtually nothing seems to change our behavior. Even though we may tighten our wallets during a downturn, we soon return to
         our usual spending behaviors. And frankly, nobody’s interested in changing the status quo: Consumer spending accounts for
         about 70 percent of the American economy.
      </p>
     
      <p class="calibre6">Frugality isn’t just about our own choices, though. There’s also the social influence to spend. Call it the <em class="calibre2">Sex and the City</em> effect, where your friends’ spending directly affects yours. Next time you go to the mall, check out any random group of
         friends. Chances are, they’re dressed similarly&mdash;even though chances are good that they have wildly different incomes. Keeping
         up with friends is a full-time job. In fact, continuing the parallel between our attitudes toward money and food that I mentioned
         in the introduction, researchers found in a landmark 2007 study published in the <em class="calibre2">New England Journal of Medicine</em> (“The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years”) that friends had a direct influence on one’s likelihood
         of gaining weight. When a friend became obese, a person increased his or her chances of becoming obese by 57 percent. How
         do you think your friends’ spending influences yours?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Too often, our friends invisibly push us away from being frugal and conscious spenders. Right around the time when the 3G
         iPhone came out, for example, I went to dinner with two friends. One of them was considering getting the new iPhone, and she
         pulled out her old phone to show us why she was thinking about buying a new one. My other friend stared in disbelief: “You
         haven’t gotten a new phone in four years? What’s wrong with you?” she asked. “You need to get the iPhone <em class="calibre2">tomorrow</em>.” Even though it was only three sentences, the message was clear: There’s something wrong with you for not getting a new
         phone (regardless of whether or not you need it).

      <h1 class="calibre11">Spend on What You Love</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rugality isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. Frugality, quite simply, is
         about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on&mdash;and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t
         love.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The mind-set of frugal people is key to being rich. Indeed, as the researchers behind the landmark book <em class="calibre2">The Millionaire Next Door</em> discovered, 50 percent of the more than one thousand millionaires surveyed have never paid more than $400 for a suit, $140
         for a pair of shoes, and $235 for a wristwatch. Again, frugality is not about simply cutting your spending on various things.
         It’s about making your own decisions about what’s important enough to spend a lot on, and what’s not, rather than blindly
         spending on <em class="calibre2">everything.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">THE PROBLEM IS THAT HARDLY ANYONE IS DECIDING WHAT’S IMPORTANT AND WHAT’S NOT, DAMMIT! That’s where the idea of conscious
         spending comes in.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">How My Friend Spends $21,000 Per Year Going Out&mdash;Guilt-Free</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span> want you to consciously decide what you’re going to spend on. No more “I guess I spent that much” when you see your credit
         card statements. No. Conscious spending means you decide exactly where you’re going to spend your money&mdash;for going out, for
         saving, for investing, for rent&mdash;and you free yourself from feeling guilty about your spending. Along with making you feel
         comfortable with your spending, a plan keeps you moving toward your goals instead of just treading water.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The simple fact is that most young people are not spending consciously. We’re spending on whatever, then reactively feeling
         good or bad about it. Every time I meet someone who has a Conscious Spending Plan (“I automatically send money to my investment
         and savings accounts, then just spend the rest”), I’m so enchanted that my love rivals Shah Jahan’s for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal
         (look it up).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-42"></a>I’m going to tell you about three friends who are spending lots and lots of money on things you might consider frivolous&mdash;like
         shoes and going out&mdash;but whose actions are perfectly justified.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE SHOE LOVER</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">My friend “Lisa” spends about $5,000/year on shoes. Because the kind of shoes she likes run more than $300, this translates
         to about fifteen pairs of shoes annually. “THAT’S RIDICULOUS!!!” you might be saying. And on the surface, that number is indeed
         large. But if you’re reading this book, you can look a little deeper: This girl makes a very healthy six-figure salary, has
         a roommate, eats for free at work, and doesn’t spend much on fancy electronics, gym membership, or fine dining. In fact, her
         job provides many of the amenities that other people pay for.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Lisa loves shoes. A lot. She’s funded her company pension and maxed out on her tax-efficient investment account. She’s putting
         away money each month for vacation and other savings goals, and giving some to charity. And she still has money left over.
         Now here’s where it’s interesting. “But Ramit,” you might say, “it doesn’t matter. Three-hundred-dollar shoes are ridiculous.
         Nobody needs to spend that much on shoes!”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Before you chastise her for her extravagance, ask yourself these questions: Have you funded your company pension and opened
         additional investment accounts? Are you fully aware of where your spending money is going? And have you made a strategic decision
         to spend on what you love? Very few people decide how they want to spend their money up front. Instead they end up spending
         it on random things here and there, eventually watching their money trickle away. Just as important, have you decided what
         you <em class="calibre2">don’t</em> love? For example, Lisa doesn’t care about living in a fancy place, so she has a tiny room in a tiny apartment. Her decision
         to live in a small place means she spends $400 less every month than many of her coworkers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">After planning for her long-term and short-term goals, she has money left over to spend on the things she loves. I think she’s
         right on.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE PARTYER</strong></h2>
      <p class="calibre6">My friend “John” spends more than $21,000 a year going out. “OMG, THAT’S SO MUCH *#%#%#% MONEY!” you might say. Well, let’s
         break it down. Say he goes out four times a week&mdash;to dinners and bars&mdash;and spend an average of $100/night. I’m being conservative
         with the numbers here, because a dinner can run $60/person and drinks could be $12 each. I’m not including bottle service,
         which might cost $800 or $1,000. (He lives in a big city.) That’s easily $400/week.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">So You Want to Judge Your Friends’ Spending?</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to judging our friends’ spending, we look at surface characteristics and make snap judgments. “You spent $300
         on jeans!” “Why do you shop at Whole Foods?” “Why did you decide to live in that expensive area?” I know we all wonder these
         things about our friends because I do, too.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">And, in fact, most of our judgments are right: Because young people are not carefully considering their financial choices
         in the context of their long-term goals&mdash;we’re not paying ourselves first and we’re not developing an investment/savings plan&mdash;you’re
         probably right when you think your friend can’t afford those $300 jeans.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">I’ve been trying to be less judgmental about this. I’m not always successful, but I now focus on the fact that the sticker
         price doesn’t matter&mdash;it’s the context around it. You want to buy a $1,000 bottle of wine? And you already saved $20,000 this
         year at age twenty-five? Great! But if your friends are going out four times a week on a $25,000 salary, I bet they’re not
         consciously spending.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">So although it’s fun to judge your friends, keep in mind that the context matters.</p>
      <p class="btx1">(Warning: If you want to judge your significant other, tread lightly: Check <a href="#calibre_link-11">page 225</a> for my breakup-prevention financial advice.)</p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">Now, John also makes a healthy six-figure salary, so he’s been able to make a Conscious Spending Plan without much difficulty.
         But even he has to decide what he doesn’t want to spend on. For example, when his coworkers took a weekend trip to Europe
         from the United States (I am not kidding), he politely passed. In fact, because he works so hard, he almost never takes vacations.
         Similarly, because he’s always at work, he doesn’t care about decorating his apartment at all, so he’s skipped virtually all
         decoration costs: He still has wire hangers holding up the few bargain suits that he wears, and he doesn’t even own a spatula.</p>
<p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Use Psychology Against Yourself to Save</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of my readers makes $50,000/year and, after working through some of my suggestions, realized she’s paying 30 percent of
         her after-tax income for subscriptions. That’s a truly shocking figure, so I want to share a method to dramatically cut down
         on unneeded subscriptions that you currently pay for. Subscriptions can be anything from LOVEFiLM to mobile phone plans to
         your cable bill. They are a business’s best friend: They let companies make a reliable, predictable income off of you<em class="calibre2">&mdash;with no action on your part.</em> There’s a convenience to this, of course&mdash;but there’s a significant cost: When was the last time you scrutinized your monthly
         subscriptions and canceled one? Probably never. Yet compare this with any recent time you went shopping. When was the last
         time you saw something you liked but decided not to buy it?
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">THE À LA CARTE METHOD</small> (updated for my UK friends).</strong> The À La Carte Method takes advantage of psychology to cut our spending. Here’s how it works: Cancel all the discretionary
         subscriptions you can: your magazines, Sky+, cable&mdash;even your gym. (It would be totally ridiculous to cancel your Internet,
         though. I’d cry like a little girl if I couldn’t get online from my house.) Then, buy what you need à la carte:
      </p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of paying for a ton of channels you never watch on cable, buy only the episodes you watch for £1.89 each off iTunes.</p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy a day pass for the gym each time you go (around £5&ndash;£10).</p>
      <p class="bl3"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy songs you want for £0.79 each from Amazon or iTunes.</p>
      <p class="ext4">The À La Carte Method works for three reasons:</p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1. You’re probably overpaying already.</strong> Most of us dramatically overestimate how much value we get from subscriptions. For example, if I asked you how many times
         a week you go to the gym, chances are you’d say, “Oh… two or three times a week.” That’s B.S. In fact, one 2006 study showed
         that gym members overestimate how much they’ll use their membership by more than 70 percent. Members who chose a monthly fee
         of about £70 attended an average of 4.3 times per month. That comes out to more than £17/gym visit&mdash;when in reality they’d
         have been better off buying pay-as-you-go passes for £10 each.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2. You’re forced to be conscious about your spending.</strong> It’s one thing to passively look at your credit card bill and say, “Ah, yes, I remember that cable bill. Looks like a valid
         charge. Tallyho!” It’s quite another to spend £1.89 each time you want to buy a TV show&mdash;and when you actively think about
         each charge, you <em class="calibre2">will</em> cut consumption.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">3. You value what you pay for.</strong> You place a higher premium on the things you pay for out of your pocket than those that come via subscripton.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">THE DOWNSIDE OF THE À LA CARTE METHOD</small>.</strong> The big downside is that this method requires you to de-automate your life. This is the price you pay for saving money. Give
         it a shot for two months and see how it feels. If you don’t like it, go back to your old subscriptions.
      </p>
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE À LA CARTE METHOD</small>:</strong></p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1.</strong> Calculate how much you’ve spent over the last month on any discretionary subscriptions you have (for example, music subscriptions,
         LOVEFiLM, and the gym).
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2.</strong> Cancel those subscriptions and begin buying these things à la carte. (But don’t let losing the gym membership be your excuse
         to become a fat ass.)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">3.</strong> In exactly one month, check and calculate how much you spent on these items over the last month. That’s the <em class="calibre2">descriptive</em> part.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1b"><strong class="calibre7">4.</strong> Now, get <em class="calibre2">prescriptive</em>. If you spent £100, try to cut it down to £90. Then £75. Not too low&mdash;you want your spending to be sustainable, and you don’t
         want to totally lose touch with what’s going on in the world. But you can control exactly how many movies you rent or how
         many magazines you buy, because each one comes out of your pocket.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Remember, this isn’t about depriving yourself. The ideal situation is that you realize you were spending £50/month in subscriptions
         for stuff you didn’t really want&mdash;now you can consciously reallocate that money into something you love.
      </p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">For John, the limiting factor is <em class="calibre2">time.</em> He knows he’ll never send money regularly anywhere, so he’s set up his investment accounts to automatically withdraw money
         before he ever sees it. The key here is that John knows himself and has set up systems to support his weaknesses. In terms
         of spending, he works hard and plays hard, going out twice during the week and twice on the weekends, when he causes some
         real damage. Yet, despite spending ungodly amounts going out each week, in just a couple of years John has saved more than
         almost any of my friends. And although $21,000 sounds outrageous on the surface, you have to take the context of his salary
         and priorities into consideration. Whereas other friends might spend thousands decorating their apartments or taking vacations,
         John, after meeting his investment goals, chooses to spend that money going out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The point here is that whether or not I agree with his choices, he’s thought about it. He sat down, considered what he wanted
         to spend on, and is executing that plan. He’s doing more than 99 percent of the young people I’ve talked to. If he had decided
         he wanted to spend $21,000/year on furry donkey costumes and Fabergé eggs, that would have been great, too. At least he has
         a plan.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE NONPROFIT EMPLOYEE</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">You don’t have to make a six-figure salary to be a conscious spender. My friend “Julie” works at a nonprofit firm in San Francisco,
         making about $40,000 per year, but she saves more than $6,000 per year&mdash;far more than most Americans.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">She does this by being extremely disciplined: She cooks at home, shares rent in a small apartment, and is reimbursed for her
         driving by her office. When she’s invited out to eat, she checks her envelope system (more on that on <a href="#calibre_link-12">page 115</a>) to see if
         she can afford it. If not, she politely declines. But when she <em class="calibre2">does</em> go out, she never feels guilty about spending because she <em class="calibre2">knows</em> she can afford it. Yet it’s not enough to save money on just rent and food. She also chooses to save aggressively, maxing
         out her pension and putting aside extra money for traveling. Each month, that money is the first to be automatically transferred
         out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">From talking to Julie at a party or over dinner, you would never know that she saves more than most Americans. We glibly make
         snap decisions about people’s spending using the most cursory data: Their job and their clothes give us most of what we think
         we need to know to understand someone’s financial situation. But Julie proves that the surface data isn’t always enough. Regardless
         of her situation, she’s chosen to put her investing and saving priorities first.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><a id="calibre_link-27"></a><strong class="calibre7">WHAT THEY’RE DOING RIGHT</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">The friends I wrote about above are exceptions to most people our age.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">They have a plan. Instead of getting caught on a spending treadmill of new phones, new cars, new vacations, and new everything,
         they plan what’s important to them and save on the rest. My shoe friend lives in a microscopic room because she’s hardly home,
         saving her hundreds per month. My partyer friend uses public transportation and has exactly zero décor in his apartment. And
         my nonprofit friend is extraordinarily detailed about every aspect of her spending.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Each of them pays themselves first, whether it’s $500/month or $2,000/ month. They’ve built an infrastructure to do this automatically
         so that by the time money ends up in their checking account, they know they can spend it guilt-free. They spend less time
         worrying about money than most people! They already know about online savings accounts and credit cards and basic asset allocation.
         They’re not experts&mdash;they’ve just got a head start.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To me, this is an enviable position to be in, and it’s a big part of what <em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> is about: automatically enabling yourself to save, invest, and spend&mdash;enjoying it, not feeling guilty about those new jeans,
         because you’re spending only what you have.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You can do it. It takes a plan. And it’s really as simple as that.</p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The <em class="calibre13">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> Conscious Spending Plan</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">C</span>learly, budgeting sucks. But agreeing that conscious spending is good is like forming a group called “Americans for Babies
         and Lovable Koala Bears.” Who would ever disagree with you? The real challenge, of course, is doing something about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s get on with the specifics of how you can make your own Conscious Spending Plan. I’m not going to lie to you: The most
         difficult thing in this book is not structuring your tax-deferred accounts or understanding the difference between APR and
         APY, it’s this section right here. But I’ll try to make it as painless as possible. Whatever you do, don’t get overwhelmed
         by the idea that you need to create a massive budgeting system. All you need is to just get a simple version ready today and
         work to improve it over time.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-78"></a>Here’s the idea: A Conscious Spending Plan involves four major buckets where your money will go: Fixed Costs, Investments,
         Savings, and Guilt-free Spending Money.

         of thumb is that fixed costs should be 50&ndash;60 percent of your take-home pay. Before you can do anything else, you’ve got to
         figure out how much these add up to. You’d think it would be easy to figure this out, right?

      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Okay, let’s walk through this step by step. Check out the chart on the next page with common basic expenses (the bare minimum
         that any ordinary person would use to live). If you see any glaring omissions for major spending categories, add them. Notice
         that I didn’t include “eating out” or “entertainment,” as those come out of the guilt-free spending category.

      <p class="calibre6">Fill in the pound amounts you know offhand.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now, to fill in the costs and categories you haven’t yet accounted for, you’re going to have to dive a little deeper. You’ll
         need to look at your past spending to fill in all the pound amounts, and to make sure you’ve covered every category. Limit
         this to the past month to keep things simple. The easiest way to get an idea of what you’ve spent where is to look at your
         credit card and banking statements or, if you’re old-fashioned, review your receipts. Sure, you may not capture every last
         expense doing it this way, but it’s probably good enough.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, once you’ve gotten all your expenses filled in, add 15 percent for expenditures you haven’t counted yet. Yes, really.
         For example, you probably didn’t capture “car repair,” which can cost £400 each time (that’s £33/month). Or dry cleaning or
         emergency vet care or charitable donations. A flat 15 percent will cover you for things you haven’t figured in, and you can
         get more accurate as time goes on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-79"></a>(I actually have a “Stupid Mistakes” category in my money system. When I first started this, I saved $20/month for unexpected
         expenses. Then, within two months, I had to go to the doctor for $600 and I got a traffic ticket for more than $100. That
         changed things quickly, and I currently save $150/month for unexpected expenses.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Once you’ve got a fairly accurate number here, subtract it from your take-home pay. Now you’ll know how much you’ll have left
         over to spend in other categories like investing, saving, and guilt-free spending. Plus, you’ll have an idea of a few targeted
         expense areas that you can cut down on to give yourself more money to save and invest.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This bucket includes the amount you’ll send to your pension and ISA each month. A good rule of thumb is to invest 10 percent
         of your take-home pay (after taxes, or the amount on your monthly paycheck) for the long term. Your pension contributions
         count toward the 10 percent, so if you already participate in a pension, you’ll need to add that amount to your take-home
         money to get a total monthly salary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re not sure how much to allot to your investing bucket, open up an investment calculator from 
         <a href="http://www.thismoney.co.uk/calculators">www.thismoney.co.uk/calculators</a> and enter some numbers. Experiment with contributing £100/month, £200/month, £500/month, or even £1,000/month. Assume an
         8 percent return. You’ll see dramatic differences over forty years.
      </p>
    <p class="calibre6">Because most of your investments will be in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which we’ll cover in <a href="#calibre_link-7">Chapter 7</a>, remove the
         taxes to get a back-of-the-napkin calculation. Just understand that taxes ultimately will take a chunk out of your pension
         returns. Remember, the more aggressively you save now, the more you’ll have later.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SAVINGS GOALS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This bucket includes short-term savings goals (like Christmas gifts and vacation), midterm savings goals (a wedding in a few
         years), and larger, longer-term goals (like a down payment on a house).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To determine how much you should be putting away each month, check out these examples. They’ll shock you:</p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">GIFTS FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY</small>.</strong> In 2007 Americans spent around $900 on Christmas gifts, according to the American Research Group. In 2008 it was about half
         of that. If you’re an average consumer and want to pay for your gifts without going into debt, that means you need to save
         £75/month for your Christmas gifts. (And what about birthday gifts?) Check out my site 
         <a href="http://www.nochristmasgiftsthisyear.com">nochristmasgiftsthisyear.com</a>.

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">The 60 Percent Solution</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou’ve heard me talk about the 85 Percent Solution, which focuses on getting most of the way there rather than 100 percent
         and ending up doing nothing at all. Well, Richard Jenkins, the editor-in-chief of MSN Money, wrote an article called “The
         60 Percent Solution,” which suggested that you split your money into simple buckets, with the largest being basic expenses
         (food, bills, taxes) making up 60 percent of your gross income. The remaining 40 percent would be split four ways:
      </p>
      <p class="ext1f"><strong class="calibre7">1.</strong> Retirement savings (10 percent)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1f"><strong class="calibre7">2.</strong> Long-term savings (10 percent)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1f"><strong class="calibre7">3.</strong> Short-term savings for irregular expenses (10 percent)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1f"><strong class="calibre7">4.</strong> Fun money (10 percent)
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">The article has been widely distributed, although curiously, none of my friends had heard of it. My Conscious Spending Plan
         relates to Jenkins’s 60 percent solution, but it’s more focused toward young people. We spend a huge amount on eating out
         and going out, whereas our housing costs are lower because we can share apartments and rent more comfortably than older people
         with families.
      </p>
    </div>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">YOUR WEDDING (WHETHER YOU’RE ENGAGED OR NOT)</small>.</strong> The average wedding costs about £20,000. Because we know the average wedding age is thirty-two for men and thirty for women,
         you can figure out exactly how much you need to be saving, assuming you want to pay for it without help or debt: If you’re
         twenty-seven years old, you need to be saving more than £300/month for your wedding. If you’re thirty, you should be saving
         more than £800/month. (I cover financing weddings in detail on <a href="#calibre_link-13">page 229</a>.)
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BUYING A HOUSE</small>.</strong> If you’re thinking about buying a house in a few years, log on to 
         <a href="http://www.mouseprice.com">www.mouseprice.com</a> and check home prices in your area. Let’s just say the average house in your neighborhood costs £300,000 and you want to
         do a traditional 20 percent down payment. That’s £60,000, so if you want to buy a house in five years, you should be saving
         £1,000/month.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Crazy, right? Nobody thinks like this, but it’s truly eye-opening when you plot out your future spending for the next few
         years. It can almost seem overwhelming, but there’s good news: First, the longer you have to save for these things, the less
         you have to save each month. (For example, if you’re a man saving for an average wedding at age twenty-four, you would have
         to save about £208/month. By age thirty-one, however, you’d have to save £1,666/month.) Second, we often get help: Our spouse
         or parents may be able to chip in a little, but you can’t count on someone else coming to rescue you. Third, theoretically
         you could use some of your investment money from Step 2 to pay for these savings goals. It’s not ideal, but you can do it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Regardless of exactly what you’re saving for, a good rule of thumb is to save 5 to 10 percent of your take-home pay to meet
         your goals.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">GUILT-FREE SPENDING MONEY</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">After all that spending, investing, and saving, this bucket contains the fun money&mdash;the stuff you can use for anything you
         want, guilt-free. Money here covers things like going out to restaurants and bars, taxis, movies, and vacations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Depending on how you’ve structured your other buckets, a good rule of thumb here is to use 20 percent to 35 percent of your
         take-home income for guilt-free spending money.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Optimizing Your Conscious Spending Plan</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow that you’ve worked out the basics of your Conscious Spending Plan, you can make some targeted improvements to tweak your
         spending and make your money go where you want it to go. Instead of having this dull, throbbing cloud of worry over your head&mdash;”I
         know I’m spending too much”&mdash;your plan will serve as a living, breathing system that signals you when something’s broken. If
         the alarm bells aren’t going off, you don’t need to waste time worrying.

      <p class="p">Optimizing your spending can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. You can do an 80/20 analysis, which often reveals
         that 80 percent of what you overspend is used toward only 20 percent of your expenditures. That’s why I prefer to focus on
         one or two big problem areas and solve those instead of trying to cut 5 percent out of a bunch of smaller areas. To run an
         80/20 analysis yourself, do a Google search for “conducting a Pareto analysis.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s take an example: Brian takes home $48,000 per year after taxes, or $4,000/month. According to his Conscious Spending
         Plan, here’s how his spending <em class="calibre2">should</em> look:
      </p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Monthly fixed costs (60 percent): $2,400</em></p>

      <p class="bl1b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Guilt-free spending money (20 percent): $800/month</em></p>
      
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Big Win: No More Fees</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span> recently had breakfast with someone who told me the most interesting story. He’d been dating his girlfriend for two years
         before they talked about finances. “It took me that long to gain her trust,” he said. She was a public school teacher, so
         she didn’t make much money. When he looked at her finances, he noticed that she had a lot of overdraft fees. He asked her
         to estimate how much she had spent in overdraft fees. “About $100 or $200?” she guessed.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">It turns out that her overdraft fees totaled $1,300 in the last year.</p>
      <p class="btx1">Did he freak out or start yelling about how to negotiate out of bank fees? No, he simply pointed out something very gently:
         “What if you focused on your overdrafts? If you eliminated <em class="calibre2">just</em> that category of fee, you’d be so much better off.” Simply avoiding overdraft fees was a big win for her.</p>
       </div>
      <p class="calibre6">Brian’s problem is that $800 isn’t enough for his spending money&mdash; this plan leaves him $250 short each month. What should
         he do?
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Bad answer:</em></strong> The superficial answer is that Brian can decrease his contributions to his long-term investments and savings goals. Sure,
         he could do that, but it will cost him down the line.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">A better way is to tackle the two most problematic areas on his monthly spending: <em class="calibre2">monthly fixed costs</em> and <em class="calibre2">guilt-free spending money.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Good answer:</em></strong> Brian decides to pick his three biggest expenses and optimize them. First, he looks at his <em class="calibre2">monthly fixed costs</em> and realizes that because he’s been consistently paying the minimum monthly payment on his credit card debt at 18 percent,
         he has $3,000 of debt left. Under his current plan, it will take him about twenty-two years and cost him $4,115 in interest
         to pay off his debt. But he can call his credit card to request a lower interest rate (see <a href="#calibre_link-14">page 42</a> for details). With his
         new lower credit card APR of 15 percent, it will take him eighteen years and he’ll pay $2,758 in interest. He saves fifty-three
         months and $1,357 of payments. That’s only $6/month, but over eighteen years it adds up to a lot.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Next, he checks his subscriptions and realizes he’s been paying for a DVD rental account and a Star Wars membership site,
         both of which he rarely uses. He cancels them, saving $60/month and increasing his chances of getting a girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, he logs in to his money-management account at 
         <a href="http://www.kublax.com">www.kublax.com</a> and realizes that he’s spending $350 eating out each month, plus $250 at bars, or $600 in total. He decides that over the
         next three months, he’ll slowly ratchet that amount down to $400/month, saving him $200/month.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Total amount saved: $266/month. By adjusting his spending, Brian is able to create a Conscious Spending Plan that works for
         him.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Brian was smart to focus on changing the things that mattered. Instead of promising that he’d stop spending money on Cokes
         every time he ate out, he picked the big wins that would really make an impact on his total dollar amount. You’ll see this
         a lot: People will get really inspired to budget and decide to stop spending on things like appetizers with dinner. Or they’ll
         buy generic cookies. That’s nice&mdash;and I definitely encourage you to do that&mdash;but those small changes will have very little effect
         on your total spending. They serve more to make people feel good about themselves, which lasts only a few weeks once they
         realize they still don’t have any more money.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Try focusing on big wins that will make a large, measurable change. In fact, I focus on only one or two big wins each month:
         eating out, and buying books because I am a huge, huge dork. You probably know what your big wins are. They’re the expenses
         you cringe at, the ones you shrug and roll your eyes at, and say, “Yeah, I probably spend too much on ____.” For most of my
         friends, these big wins are eating out and drinking.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SET REALISTIC GOALS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Last year, a friend of mine started getting really into fitness. I think it was because of his laudable goal of “getting some
         girls.” Kudos, sir. Anyway, he started working out a lot: going to the gym in the morning, running during the day, then hitting
         the gym <em class="calibre2">again</em> at night. Needless to say, this fitness program didn’t last long. Do you know people who get so into their idea du jour that
         they go completely overboard and burn out? I would rather do less but make it sustainable. The problem is that that’s rarely
         sexy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">This idea of sustainable change is core to personal finance. Sometimes I get e-mails from people who say things like, “Ramit!
         I started managing my money! Before, I was spending $500 a week! Now I’m saving $495 of it and putting it into a bank account!”
         I read this and just sigh. Although you might expect me to get really excited about someone contributing $495/month to their
         savings, I’ve come to realize that when a person goes from one extreme to another, the behavioral change rarely lasts.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">M</span><em class="calibre2">y friend and I are the same age, make roughly the same amount, and have similar lifestyles. So, over five years, why was I
            able to save $20,000 for a down payment and buy a house… and he ended up with hardly anything? He came to talk to me about
            it one day.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">We soon sorted out that the key difference was that we had a different approach to saving money. In his mind, he was simply
            “saving.” I, on the other hand, was “saving for a down payment.” Though it might not seem like a big deal, that small distinction
            makes all the difference in the world. I brought in a bag lunch because I was saving toward a house, he brought in a bag lunch
            because he was simply saving. When it came time for lunch, his was merely a decision between whether he wanted his sandwich
            or something different. For me, it was whether I was willing to sacrifice that $5 or $10 that could be going toward a house
            on something more interesting to eat that day. Saving with a goal&mdash;whether it’s tangible like a house or intangible like your
            kid’s education&mdash;puts all your decisions into focus.</em></p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MAKE THE TRADEOFFS WORTHWHILE</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">Having a goal means that you are working toward something concrete. It gives you a reason to make those tradeoffs. You don’t
            just think of that $5 saved as $5&mdash;instead it is something that gets you closer to your goal of having $20,000 for a down payment
            on a home. It changes the entire motivation for saving.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Spending less isn’t always easy, but with this newfound motivation, it’s much easier to make and justify your decisions. For
            a while, I was only going out with my friends one night a week, rather than the two or three times we normally did. This still
            gave me a chance to hang out with my buddies, but I was spending one-third less than I used to! When my friends asked, I told
            them I couldn’t go out because I was saving up for a down payment. They accepted this as a pretty good reason not to go out
            all the time. My friends might give me grief if I was simply being lazy, or lame, but because I had a concrete goal&mdash;and one
            that they could identify with&mdash; they became supporters of my cause rather than unwitting detractors.</em></p>
      
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">SET UP A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">Another key difference was how I was saving. I opened up an ING Direct savings account and named it “Down Payment,” regularly
            transferring in the amount I had determined I wanted to save. As the months passed, the amount in that account grew larger
            and larger, and I felt as though I was making progress toward my goal. My friend never set aside an account, so his regular
            checking account was one big pot of money mentally “earmarked” for various things. His account balance grew but he had no
            pride of achievement or sense of closing in on his goal (because he didn’t have a goal). It’s possible that he could have
            saved as much as I had and just not have known it!</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">That second difference was psychological. Rather than being motivated to save, he developed a feeling of despair about it.
            Trying to save $20,000 sounds daunting until you spread it out over three years&mdash;then it’s $555 a month. Spread it out over
            five years and it’s only $333 a month (not including interest earned). That’s certainly doable if you make sacrifices and
            track your progress. After my friend opened a separate account, he told me that this step alone changed his whole perspective
            about saving money for his down payment (once he accomplished that goal, he planned to use the account to save for his annual
            vacations and his emergency fund).</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">ENJOY LUNCH!</small></strong> <em class="calibre2">Don’t listen to experts telling you that you should stop buying CDs or how you should brown bag a lunch. Think about your
            goals. Ask yourself if you’d rather spend $10 on lunch or save $10 toward a house or a car. If you would rather spend the
            money on lunch, by all means enjoy lunch! You save money so that you can spend it later on the things that make you happy.
            You don’t save money just to watch your account balance grow. Once you list your goals and start making those trade-offs,
            you’ll realize that saving money becomes far easier.</em></p>

 <p class="calibre6">When I make a change, I almost always make it bite-sized in an area that matters (see my previous discussion of big wins)
         and work in increments from there. This is why I just shake my head when I see personal-finance pundits giving families advice
         to go from a zero percent savings rate to a 25 percent savings rate (“You can do it!!!”). Giving that kind of advice is not
         useful. Habits don’t change overnight, and if they do, chances are it won’t be sustainable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">For example, if I started keeping track of my expenses and discovered I was short $1,000/month (this happens more than you
         think), I’d pick the two big wins&mdash;two items that I spend a lot on, but know I could cut down with some effort&mdash;and focus my
         efforts on them. Say I was spending about $500/month eating out, here’s how it would look:
      </p>
      <p class="ext2">Month 1: ................ $475 on eating out</p>
      <p class="ext3">Month 2: ................ $450 on eating out</p>
      <p class="ext3">Month 3: ................ $400 on eating out</p>
      <p class="ext3">Month 4: ................ $350 on eating out</p>
      <p class="ext3">Month 5: ................ $300 on eating out</p>
      <p class="ext1d">Month 6: ................ $250 on eating out</p>
      <p class="calibre6">It’s not a race, but within six months, I’d have cut my eating out budget <em class="calibre2">in half.</em> And it’d be much more likely to be sustainable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The other way to do it is to look at your current spending, freak out, and cut half your total spending. Then you’re suddenly
         forced to spend in a completely different way, without the means to cope. How long do you think your ambitious spending goal
         will last?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">How many times have you heard friends say something like, “I’m not going to drink for a month”? I don’t understand the point
         of short-term whims like that. A month from now, okay, you spent only 50 percent of what you normally do. And… then what?
         If you can’t keep it up and you bounce right back to your normal spending habits, what did you really accomplish? I’d rather
         have people cut their spending by 10 percent and sustain it for thirty years than cut 50 percent for just a month.

      <p class="calibre6">Whether you’re implementing a change in your personal finances, eating habits, exercise plan, or whatever… try making the
         smallest change today. Something you won’t even notice. And follow your own plan for gradually increasing it. In this way,
         time is your friend because each month gets better than the one before it, and it adds up to a lot in the end.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">USE THE ENVELOPE SYSTEM TO TARGET YOUR BIG WINS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">All this conscious spending and optimizing sounds nice in theory, but how do you do it? I recommend the envelope system, in
         which you allocate money for certain categories like eating out, shopping, rent, and so on. Once you spend the money for that
         month, that’s it: You can’t spend more. If it’s really an emergency, you can dip into other envelopes at the cost of spending
         in <em class="calibre2">that</em> category. These “envelopes” can be figurative (like in Kublax or Excel) or literally envelopes that you put cash in. This
         is the best system I’ve found for keeping spending simple and sustainable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">One of my friends, for example, has been carefully watching her spending for the last few months. When she started tracking
         her spending, she noticed that she was spending an unbelievable amount going out every week. So she came up with a clever
         solution to control her discretionary spending. She set up a separate bank account with a debit card. At the beginning of
         each month, she transfers, let’s say, $200, into it. When she goes out, she spends that money. And when it’s gone, it’s gone.
      </p>
      
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">The Envelope System</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1.</strong> Decide how much you want to spend in major categories each month. (Not sure? Start with one: Eating out.)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2.</strong> Put money in each envelope (category):</p>
         <p class="img2"><img src="images/00015.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="ext1a1"><strong class="calibre7">3.</strong> You can transfer from one envelope to another…</p>
         <p class="img2"><img src="images/00014.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
         <p class="ext1a1">… but when the envelopes are empty, that’s it for the month.
      </p>
    </div>
      <p class="calibre6">Tip: If you want to make sure you don’t go overdrawn, ask your bank if you can sign up for text alerts that tell you when
         you’re near your limit. Not all banks offer them and some will charge a fee for you to receive them. Most banks can’t block
         transactions to stop you from going overdrawn, but they can normally warn you that your funds are getting low. If you don’t
         do this, you’ll likely run up tons of overdraft fees.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Whatever system you want to use to divvy up the money is fine. Just decide how much you want to spend in major categories
         each month. (Pick your big wins to start.) Put the allotted money in each “envelope.” When the envelopes are empty, that’s
         it for the month. You can transfer from one envelope to another… but that money is coming out of another category, so your
         total spending doesn’t actually increase.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Some of my nerdier friends even get more detailed with their system. One of my readers created this table:</p>
      <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
      <table width="90%" class="calibre8">
         <tr class="calibre9">
            <td class="new2">&nbsp;</td>
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Eating out</strong></td>
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Taxis</strong></td>
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Books</strong></td>
         </tr>
         <tr class="calibre9">
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Times per month</strong></td>

         <tr class="calibre9">

            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£23</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£9</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£17</strong></td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Each month, I try to cut the quantity and amount I spend on something,” he told me. I looked at him in shock, but how can
         I argue? In less than eight months, he cut his spending by 43 percent (he knew the exact figure, of course). In my opinion,
         that level of analysis is overkill for most people, but it shows how detailed you can get once you set up a Conscious Spending
         Plan.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">What If You Don’t Make Enough Money?</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">D</span>epending on your financial situation, setting up a workable Conscious Spending Plan may seem out of reach for you. Some people
         have already cut their spending to the bone and still don’t have any extra money. For me to suggest that they put away 10
         percent for retirement is, frankly, insulting. How can they be expected to contribute 10 percent toward long-term savings
         when they don’t have enough to fill the car with gas?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Sometimes this is reality, and sometimes it’s perception. Many of the people who’ve written me saying they live paycheck to
         paycheck actually have more wiggle room in their budgets than they think (cooking instead of eating out, for example, or not
         buying a new mobile phone every year). They just don’t <em class="calibre2">want</em> to change their spending.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">However, it’s true that many people really cannot afford to cut more spending and really are living check to check. If you
         simply can’t cut more out of your budget, this spending plan may be a useful theoretical guide, but you have more important
         concerns: making more money. Once you increase your earnings, you can use the Conscious Spending Plan as your guide. Until
         then, here are three strategies you can use to earn more.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">NEGOTIATE A RAISE</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you already have a job, it’s worth trying to negotiate a raise even in the current climate. A recent study by NACE, the
         National Association of Colleges and Employers, showed that companies pay more than $5,000 to hire the average college graduate.
         If you’ve been out of school for a few years, it’s even more expensive. If they’ve already spent $5,000 recruiting you, and
         thousands more training you, would they really want to lose you?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Asking for a raise takes careful planning. Don’t do what my friend “Jamie” did. When he realized he was being drastically
         underpaid for his contributions, he seethed without taking any action for more than two months. When he finally got up the
         courage to ask his boss for a raise, he said it in the most timid way: “Do you think I might possibly ask you about a raise?”
         If you’re a manager, the first thing you’d think is, “Oh God, not another thing in my day.” My friend’s boss brushed him off,
         leaving Jamie, who’s still at the company, frustrated and underpaid.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Remember that getting a raise is not about you. It’s about you demonstrating your value to your employer. You can’t tell them
         you need more money because your expenses are higher. Nobody cares. You <em class="calibre2">can,</em> however, show how your work has been clearly contributing to the company’s success, and ask to be compensated fairly. Here’s
         what you need to do:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Three months before you ask for a raise, start tracking everything you do at work <em class="calibre2">and the results you get.</em> If you were on a team that sold 25,000 widgets, figure out what you did to help make that happen and, as much as possible,
         quantify it. If you can’t figure out the exact results you’re causing, ask someone at work who’s more experienced. This is
         a classic question that new employees have, and many experienced coworkers would be happy to help you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">At the same time, ask your boss if you can sit down and discuss ways you can excel at work. Make it clear you want to exceed
         expectations, and ask what that would entail. If you’re really clever, you can hint about discussing compensation in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Two months before you ask for a raise, meet with your boss again and show him your tracking from the previous month. Ask what
         you could do better. You want to know if you’re on the right track with your work and, more important, the way you’re communicating
         it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">One month before the big event, mention to your boss that because you’ve been doing so well, you’d like to discuss compensation
         at a meeting the next month. Ask what you’ll need to bring to make it a fruitful discussion. Listen very carefully to what
         he says.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Around this time, it wouldn’t hurt to ask your fellow coworkers to put in a good word with the boss. This assumes, of course,
         that you’ve been exceeding expectations and driving concrete results.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Two weeks before you ask for a raise, ask a couple of friends to role-play your job negotiation. This seems really weird,
         but negotiating is <em class="calibre2">not</em> a natural behavior. It will feel extremely odd and uncomfortable the first couple of times you do it. Better to do it with
         friends than your boss. And pick good friends, people who have business experience and will give you feedback on how you performed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">On the day you negotiate, come in with your salary, a couple of competitive salaries from 
         <a href="http://www.salaryexpert.com">www.salaryexpert.com</a> and 
         <a href="http://www.mysalary.co.uk">www.mysalary.co.uk</a>, and your list of accomplishments, and be ready to discuss fair compensation. Remember, you’re not asking your mommy for
         lemonade, you’re a professional who’s asking to be compensated fairly. You want to proceed as partners, as in “How do we make
         this work?”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you get the raise you were looking for, congratulations! That was a huge first step toward increasing your income. If you
         don’t, ask your boss what you can do to excel in your career, or consider leaving to find another company that will give you
         greater room to grow.

      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o find your annual salary, just take your hourly rate, double it, and add three zeros to the end. If you make £20/hour, you
         make approximately £40,000/year. If you make £30/hour, you make approximately £60,000/year.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">This also works in reverse. To find your hourly rate, divide your salary by two and drop the three zeros. So £50,000/year

         hours of work, is it worth it?
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">When I was in college, I used to measure those decisions by the number of quarters I’d have to trade away from my laundry
         stash. Those may have been the most intellectually rigorous years of my life.

      <p class="p">This takes us to the second way to increase your income. If you find that your existing company doesn’t offer you growth potential,
         or you’re in the process of getting a new job, negotiating your salary will never be easier. During the job-hiring process,
         you have more leverage than you’ll ever have.

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">DO SOME FREELANCE WORK</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Freelancing can be a relatively easy way to earn some extra money. Think about what skills or interests you have that others
         could use. You don’t necessarily have to have a technical skill. Babysitting is freelancing (and it pays very well). If you
         have free time, you can pitch for work at 
         <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com">www.peopleperhour.com</a>. Tutoring is also a simple, profitable way to make some extra side cash: You might be able to moonlight at a company like
         Kaplan and help kids with test prep, or you can post a notice at your neighborhood library and offer to teach English, math,
         or anything. What about dog walking? Remember, busy people want others to help them with their lives. A great place to start
         is 
         <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com">www.gumtree.com</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">If you have expertise in something, reach out to companies who’d need someone like you. For example, when I was in high school,
         I e-mailed fifty websites from all different industries that looked interesting but had poor marketing and copywriting. I
         offered to help them rewrite their websites. About fifteen responded, and I ended up editing copy for one company that eventually
         promoted me to run their sales department.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Later, during college, I consulted for venture capitalists, teaching them about Web 2.0 technologies, like YouTube, Facebook,
         and Flickr. This is stuff you and I know like the back of our hand, but it was new to these VCs&mdash;and valuable enough that they
         paid a great consulting fee.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Maintaining Your Spending Plan</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">O</span>nce you’ve done what you can to design and implement a Conscious Spending Plan that you’re comfortable with, give yourself
         some time to settle into a rhythm with it. Sure, eventually you can spend your time on strategic money decisions&mdash;“Should I
         be contributing 10 percent or 12 percent to my monthly savings goals?”&mdash;but first, you’ve got to get the basics down. As you
         go along from month to month with this new system, you’ll discover some surprises you hadn’t anticipated.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You’ll always have unexpected cash expenses like cabs or an umbrella when you forgot yours. And don’t flip out if you miss
         tracking a few pounds here or there&mdash;the minute your system becomes too oppressive for you to use is the minute you stop using
         it. I try to make as many purchases on my credit card as possible, so my software can automatically download my transactions.
         For cash spending, try to get the receipts and enter them into your system within seven days. After that, I tend to lose receipts
         or let them build up so much that I forget what some of the receipts were for. Make tracking your spending a weekly priority.
         For example, set aside thirty minutes every Sunday afternoon.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">HOW TO HANDLE UNEXPECTED AND IRREGULAR EXPENSES</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">It can be frustrating to have a spending plan that keeps getting disrupted by surprise expenses like wedding gifts, car repairs,
         and late fees. So another key to having a plan you’ll use is to account for the unexpected and build in a bit of flexibility.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Known irregular events</em></strong> (vehicle registration fees, Christmas gifts, vacations). There’s an easy way to account for this type of irregular event.
         In fact, this is already built into your spending plan: Under <em class="calibre2">Savings Goals,</em> you allocate money toward goals where you have a general idea of how much it will cost. It doesn’t have to be exact, but
         try to get a rough ballpark figure and then save every month toward that goal. For example, if you know you’ll have to spend
         about £500 on Christmas gifts, start saving £42/month (that’s £500 divided by twelve months) in January. By the time December
         rolls around, you won’t have to take a huge hit on your spending.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Unknown irregular events</em></strong> (surprise vet expenses, late fees for your library card, or £50 flowers to make up to your girlfriend for something stupid
         you did last night). These types of surprises fall under your <em class="calibre2">Monthly Fixed Expenses</em> because no matter how hard you try to avoid them, there will always be unexpected expenses. Earlier, I suggested that you
         add about 15 percent to your estimate of your fixed costs to accommodate these surprises. In addition, I recommend starting
         by allocating £50/month for unexpected expenses. You’ll soon realize that this cartoonishly low figure is not enough. But
         with some time, you’ll have a better idea of what the figure should actually be and can change the amount accordingly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Fortunately, with each month that goes by, you’ll get a more accurate picture of your spending. After about a year or two
         (remember, think long term), you’ll have a very accurate understanding of how to project. The beginning is the hard part,
         but it only gets easier.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE “PROBLEM” OF EXTRA INCOME</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Just as there are surprise expenses, there is also surprise income. It’s tempting to take a windfall and blow it all on something
         fun, but I urge you not to follow that instinct. Instead, work within your Conscious Spending Plan.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Unexpected onetime income.</em></strong> Sometimes money unexpectedly falls in your lap, like a birthday gift or from selling something on eBay. Believe it or not,
         I don’t encourage you to save all this money. Instead, whenever I make money I didn’t expect, I use 50 percent of it for fun&mdash;usually
         buying something I’ve been eyeing for a long time. Always! This way, I keep motivating myself to pursue weird, offbeat ideas
         that may result in some kind of reward. The other half goes to my investing account. Compare this with not having a plan and
         letting your money “just sort of” get spent.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Raises.</em></strong> A raise is different from onetime income because you’ll get it consistently, and it’s therefore much more important to do
         the right thing financially. There’s one important thing to remember when you get a raise: Maintain your current standard
         of living. Too many people get a raise at work and say, “Great! I’ll go on that vacation!” Sure, you can do that. Then, “I’ll
         buy that new sofa I’ve been wanting!” Uh oh. And then, “I think I need those new shoes. What? I’ve been working hard!” And
         then you want to kill yourself because you’re swirling into a downward spiral of spending.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you get a raise, be realistic: You earned it, and you should enjoy the results of your hard work. Buy yourself something
         nice that you’ve been wanting for a long time, and make it something you’ll remember. After that, however, I strongly encourage
         you to save and invest as much of it as possible, because once you start getting accustomed to a certain lifestyle, you can
         never go back. After buying a Mercedes, can you ever drive a Toyota Corolla again?

      <p class="calibre6">The best part about setting up a strategic budget is that <em class="calibre2">it</em> guides your decisions, letting you say no much more easily&mdash;“Sorry, it’s not in my plan this month”&mdash;and freeing you up to
         enjoy what you do spend on. This is guilt-free spending at its best. Sure, there will be tough decisions. Deciding to change
         the way you spend is the most difficult part of this book. It involves making choices and saying no to certain things. Your
         system, however, makes this much less painful. If a friend asks you out to dinner and you don’t have enough spending money
         left, it will be easier to politely pass. After all, it’s not personal&mdash;it’s just your <em class="calibre2">system.</em> Remember that most people are, by definition, ordinary. They go through their twenties and thirties feeling a gnawing sense
         that they “should” do something about their money&mdash; tomorrow. They don’t think about saving until their mid-forties. And yet,
         you are now extraordinary, because you see that setting up a simple system will let you make the tough decisions up front
         and spend your money guilt-free.

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">DO MORE BEFORE DOING LESS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Some people just seem to have a magical ability to manage money. They enrolled in their pension years ago, they always know
         how much money they have, and they seem to relish tweaking their system to optimize it. Usually, these people are extremely
         annoying and unattractive. But that doesn’t mean we can’t learn something from them. You see, they don’t spend more time on
         day-to-day money management than most average people. In fact, they spend <em class="calibre2">less</em> time thinking about their money because they’ve set up an automated system that frees them from having to worry. These people
         don’t work harder, they just work smarter.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You can become one of these people (only you’ll be very attractive and not at all annoying) if you follow my advice about
         automating. This is all driven by a principle I’ll call The Curve of Doing More Before Doing Less:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">This is as much about where to invest your time as it is about where to put your money. Sure, setting up an Automatic Money
         Flow will take you a few hours. It would be easier to do nothing&mdash;but that would mean you’ll have to manage your money constantly
         for the rest of your life. By spending a few hours up front, you’ll end up saving huge amounts of time over the long term.
         Your money flow will be automatic, and each pound that comes in will be routed to the right account in your Conscious Spending
         Plan from <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a> without you really having to think about it.

      <p class="img"><img src="images/00001.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="calibre6">The payoff for these few hours is huge because this automatic system will let you focus on the fun parts of life. No more
         worrying about whether you paid that bill or if you’re going to overdraft again. You’ll start to see money as a tool for getting
         what you want without the manual drudgery of tracking categories and transferring money from one account to another each week.

      <p class="p">We know people are incredibly lazy and will do whatever requires no work&mdash;often at their own financial expense. Think about
         how many people lose thousands of pounds per year by not taking advantage of employer pension contributions matches alone.
         How much more money do we lose from inaction overall?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The key to taking action is, quite simply, making your decisions automatic. You think you’ll actually do the work each week?
         No, you won’t. You don’t care. Sure, you might care right now, but in two weeks it’ll be back to Twitter and Perez Hilton.
         Nobody really cares about managing their money. Hell, I don’t even care. Get away from me, endless mailings from banks and
         investment accounts. (That’s the line I will use as a bedtime story to soothe my future children. I know, I know. My future
         wife is a lucky woman.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>Your money management must happen by default. We’ve already talked about it in reference to pensions, but now we’re going
         to apply that to every pound you make. You’ll be making your contributions to your savings and investing accounts grow passively&mdash;with
         no action required. In fact, by setting up an automatic payment plan you actually make it difficult to <em class="calibre2">stop</em> the contributions to your retirement account! Not because you can’t&mdash;you can adjust your system any time&mdash;but because you’re
         lazy and you won’t. Hey, I’m lazy, too. You just have to know how to take advantage of it. Once it’s set up, this system is
         so hands-off that if you got eaten alive by a Komodo dragon, your money system would continue transferring money from account
         to account by default, a ghostlike reminder of your financial prescience. Haunting, but cool.

         to assign to the four categories (or buckets) in the table on the next page.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now, let’s take your Conscious Spending Plan and make it automatic. To do this, I use a concept called “The Next £100.” This
         means, simply, where will the next £100 you make go? Will it all go to your investment account? Will you allocate 10 percent
         to your savings account? Most people just shrug and don’t take any time to think about how their money will be allocated&mdash;which
         means it gets thoughtlessly spent and I sob uncontrollably.

      <p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">But there’s a better way! It involves actually using the guidelines you established in your Conscious Spending Plan. If you
         did things right in <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a>, you already know how much money you want to contribute to your fixed costs, investments, savings,
         and spending money. So, if you made £100, and your plan resembled the example above, you’d put £60 toward your fixed costs,
         £10 into your investment account, £10 into savings, and then you’d spend the remaining £20 on whatever you felt like. Pretty
         cool, right? Well, it gets even better, because once everything is automated, that money will be shunted from your current
         account right into the appropriate accounts without you even thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To see how it works, let’s use Michelle as an example:</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Michelle gets paid once a month. Her employer deducts 5 percent of her pay automatically and puts it in her pension. The rest
         of Michelle’s paycheck goes to her checking account by direct deposit.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">About a day later, her Automatic Money Flow begins transferring money out of her checking account. Her personal retirement
         account will pull 5 percent of her salary for itself. (That combines with the company pension contribution to complete the
         10 percent of take-home pay for investing.) Her savings account will pull 5 percent, automatically breaking that money into
         chunks: 1 percent for a wedding sub-account and 4 percent to a house down-payment sub-account. (That takes care of her monthly
         savings goals.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Her system also automatically pays her fixed costs. She’s set it up so that most of her subscriptions and bills are paid by
         her credit card. Some of her bills can’t be put on credit cards&mdash;for example, utilities and loans&mdash;so they’re automatically
         paid out of her checking account. Finally, she’s automatically e-mailed a copy of her credit card bill for a five-minute review.
         After she’s reviewed it, the bill is also paid from her checking account.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">The money that remains in her account is used for spending money. To make sure she doesn’t overspend, she’s focused on two
         big wins: eating out and spending money on clothes. She sets alerts in her online budgeting account if she goes over her spending
         goals, and she keeps a reserve of $500 in her checking account just in case. (The couple of times she went over her spending,
         she paid herself back using her “unexpected expenses” money from her savings account.) To track spending more easily, she
         uses her credit card as much as possible to pay for all of her fun stuff. If she uses cash for cabs or coffee, she keeps the
         receipts and tries to enter them into Mint as often as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In the middle of the month, Michelle’s calendar reminds her to check her Mint account to make sure she’s within her limits
         for her spending money. If she’s doing fine, she gets on with her life. If she’s over her limit, she decides what she needs
         to cut back on to stay on track for the month. Luckily, she has fifteen days to get it right, and by politely passing on an
         invitation to dine out she gets back on track.
      </p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">I work freelance and it is often difficult to plan for the future, but I set up a savings goal and now I have a cushion for
            the tough times. I have two jobs; one I love and one I hate. The one I love pays for the things I love, and the one I hate
            pays for the things I hate paying for, like bills. This means I can easily balance how I save for the future by doing extra
            hours when I need to, without sacrificing doing things that I love.</em></p>

         exactly what she wanted to spend. She had to say “no” only once, and it was no big deal. In fact, none of it was.

      <p class="calibre6">Alternatively, remember that on <a href="#calibre_link-68">page 88</a> I mentioned that I use a PBwiki account to store all of this information. It’s well
         worth taking an hour to get all these handy account numbers in one place so you never have to do this again.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Also, before you start linking your online accounts, you may need to work with your employer to get your paycheck going to
         the proper places. If you don’t already have it, talk to your HR rep and set up a direct deposit into your current account.
         (For most of you lucky Brits, this is already standard.) In addition, you need to get everything squared away with your pension
       contribution. Ideally you already set up your pension way back in <a href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter 3</a>, but if not, DO IT NOW! Even if you already have
         a pension going, you may have to adjust the amount you contribute every month based on your shiny new Conscious Spending Plan.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SETTING UP EASY PAYMENTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you’ve got online accounts, you can easily set up payments between them. Otherwise, get your bank to set up regular standing
         orders from your current account.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2">This is how your easy payments system should work:</p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re paying into a company pension scheme or a stakeholder plan that’s been set up by your employer, money will automatically
         come out of your wages. If you’ve taken out your own personal or stakeholder pension, you should set up standing order payments
         so money comes out of your current account every month.
      </p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a regular transfer between your current account and your savings account.</p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a regular payment or standing order to your stocks and shares ISA</p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay your bills by direct debit or standing order. You can pay by credit card (which may help you keep your accounts active),
         but direct debit or standing order give you more protection. If you want to stop a regular payment you’re making with your
         credit card, you have to cancel it with the company you’re paying (you can’t ask the card provider to stop it for you).
      </p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Some bills can’t be paid by credit card (even if you wanted to). Pay these by standing order or direct debit from your current
         account.
      </p>
      <p class="bl4"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Set it up so that all your credit card accounts are paid from your current account. (This is something you need to do from
         your bank’s website.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, there are payments that simply can’t be automatically drawn from your current account. For example, if you’re renting
         from a little old lady, she may not have a sophisticated financial infrastructure including a website where you can enter
         your current account information and automatically transfer money each month. Sigh. Get it together, Mildred. Anyway, you
         can still set up your account to transfer money into hers; you only need to get hold of her bank details including her account
         number and sort code. If she prefers payment by cheque, you’ll have no option but to write one out and put it in the post.
         At the very least, you should set up alerts on your budgeting software so you don’t forget to do it.

      <p class="p">Now that all your accounts are linked, it’s time to go back into your accounts and automate all transfers and payments. This
         is really simple: It is just a matter of working with each individual account’s website to make sure your payment or transfer
         is set up for the amount you want (or if it’s a direct debit, the amount the company is requesting) and on the date you want.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re paying your bills by direct debit or standing order, you can choose the date the money leaves your account. This
         is key, but people often overlook it. If you set your direct debits or standing orders at weird times, it will inevitably
         necessitate more work. If you get paid on the 1st of the month, you want to avoid having to deal with lots of different payments
         on different dates.

      <h3 class="h3a"><strong class="calibre7">by Gina Trapani of Lifehacker.com</strong></h3>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">T</span><em class="calibre2">ech-savvy folks who want to get more done in less time don’t want to fuss with tedious money tasks like writing checks and
            transferring funds, so financial automation is very popular among the Lifehacker readership. Personally, I’m right there:
            “Set it and forget it” is my guiding personal finance system principle. Well, not exactly “forget it,” but I set up my accounts
            to run themselves to the extent they can, and check in on things monthly to make sure all the gears are turning as I intended.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">I’m a busy person who doesn’t want to think about money matters any more than I need to, so I rely heavily on automated transfers,
            deposits, and e-mail notifications to keep my dollars and cents where they need to be. Most good banks these days offer electronic
            bill pay, direct deposit, recurring savings account transfers, and some even offer e-mail notifications if an account balance
            goes above or below a certain threshold. I use all these tools. My income goes in, bill payments go out, and my credit card
            gets paid in full with minimal intervention. If my credit card debt in a given month goes above a certain threshold&mdash;like $3,000&mdash;I
            get an e-mail letting me know so I can make sure I’ve got that cash ready in my checking account. For week-to-week money tasks,
            this all works like a charm.</em></p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">TOOLS OF THE TRADE</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">For a longer, bird’s-eye view of my finances, I use a desktop copy of Quicken to suck in all my account transactions and make
            me pretty charts. Using Quicken, I check in on my net worth over time and see if there are any expenses that I can cut down.
            This kind of overview work is where I spend the most time&mdash;deciding on my savings goals, tracking them, seeing where I was
            at the same time last year, plotting where I want to be at the same time next year. Being a personal productivity obsessive,
            I’m big on having goals and using checkpoints along the way to get there. I use Google Calendar to set twelve savings goals
            throughout the year, with an e-mail reminder for each one. At the end of each month I get an e-mail from my calendar saying
            something like, “It’s October! Should be $X in the nest egg account by now!” That really keeps me on track when life has swept
            me away and I’m thinking about other things.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">As a freelancer, things get tricky around tax time&mdash;and tax time happens four times a year for self-employed folks. I use automated
            monthly transfers into an income tax holding account so I can pay my quarterly estimated taxes without feeling like I just
            lost my shirt. (That’s not a good feeling, ever&mdash;so do whatever you have to do to avoid it. In fact, keeping an attitude of
            confidence and prosperity is one of the best financial moves you can make, regardless of what your account balance is.) I
            use a simple spreadsheet to track deductions, and a big manila envelope to keep original receipts&mdash;one envelope per year.</em></p>
      
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">STRATEGIES FOR DEBT</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">Some of the best debt reduction strategies we’ve gotten from Lifehacker readers involve tricking yourself into putting money
            aside, and making it hard to spend. Many endorse the old-fashioned way: Cut up the credit cards, and pay down the ones with
            the highest interest rates most aggressively. Another strategy to avoid impulse buying is filling up online shopping carts
            or wishlists and then making yourself wait a week or two before you pull the trigger and hit the “Check out” button. I use
            this method a lot: Usually, impulse buys make much less sense when you’ve had some time to think about it.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">In the end, managing your finances well is a lot like developing a strong personal productivity system: You keep track of
            everything without making it your full-time job; you set goals; you break them down into small bite-size tasks; you save yourself
            time by automating manual work; and you spend your time and brainpower focusing on the big picture. That’s what I try to do
            with my time</em> and <em class="calibre2">money.</em></p>

      </p>
<p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">The easiest way to avoid this is to get all your bills on the same schedule. To accomplish this, gather all your bills together,
         call the companies, and ask them to switch your billing dates. Most of these will take five minutes each to do. There may
         be a couple of months of odd billing as your accounts adjust, but it will smooth itself out after that. If you’re paid on
         the 1st of the month, I suggest switching all your bills to arrive on or around that time, too. Call and say this: “Hi, I’m
         currently being billed on the 17th of each month, and I’d like to change that to the 1st of the month. Do I need to do anything
         besides ask right here on the phone?” Of course, depending on your situation, you can request any billing date that will be
         easy for you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Now that you’ve got everything coming at the beginning of the month, it’s time to actually go in and set up your transfers.
         Here’s how to arrange your Automatic Money Flow, assuming you get paid on the 1st of the month.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">1st of the month:</em></strong> Your pension contributions are automatically deducted from your paycheck, if you’re paying into an occupational pension scheme
         a group personal pension or a stakeholder organised by your employer. If you’re paying into a pension plan that you’ve arranged
         yourself (either a personal or stakeholder plan), money should be taken from your current account as soon after your paycheck
         reaches your account as possible. Remember, you’re treating your current account like your e-mail inbox&mdash; first, everything
         goes there, then it’s filtered away to the appropriate place. Note: The first time you set this up, leave a buffer amount
         of money&mdash;I recommend £500&mdash;in your current account just in case a transfer doesn’t go right. And don’t worry: If something
         <em class="calibre2">does</em> go wrong, use the negotiation tips on <a href="#calibre_link-69">page 24</a> to get any overdraft fees waived.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5th of the month:</em></strong> Set up your regular payment to your savings account. Log in to your savings account and set up an automatic transfer from
         your current account to your savings account on the 5th of every month. Waiting until the 5th of the month gives you some
         leeway. If, for some reason, your paycheck doesn’t show up on the 1st of the month, you’ll have four days to correct things
         or cancel that month’s automatic transfer.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Don’t just set up the transfer. Remember to set the amount, too. Use the percentage of your monthly income that you established
         for savings in your Conscious Spending Plan (typically 5 to 10 percent). But if you can’t afford that much right now, don’t
         worry&mdash;just set up an automatic transfer for £5 to prove to yourself that it works. The amount is important: £5 won’t be missed,
         but once you see how it’s all working together, it’s much easier to add to that amount.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5th of the month:</em></strong> Regular payment to your personal pension or stocks and shares ISA. To set this up, log in to your bank’s website and create
         a regular payment from your current account to your pension or ISA. Refer to your Conscious Spending Plan to calculate the
         amount of the transfer. It should be approximately 10 percent of your take-home pay, minus the amount you send to your company
         pension.

         student loans, and set up automatic payments to occur on the 7th of each month. You can pay your bills by direct debit, standing
         order (if it’s for a fixed amount) or by credit card. If you pay by credit card remember that you can’t cancel your payments
         through the credit card company, only the company that’s supplying the services. If you’re in dispute with them, there could
         be problems. Track your spending on sites like 
         <a href="http://www.kublax.com">www.kublax.com</a> or by using Personal Accountz software.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">7th of the month:</em></strong> Automatic transfer to pay off your credit card. Log in to your credit card account and instruct it to draw money from your
         current account and pay the credit card bill on the 7th of every month&mdash;in full. (Because your bill arrived on the 1st of the
         month, you’ll never incur late fees using this system.) If you have credit card debt and you can’t pay the bill in full, don’t
         worry. You can still set up an automatic payment; just make it for the monthly minimum or any other amount of your choice.
         (See <a href="#calibre_link-70">page 39</a> to learn why this is a very good idea.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re using an online credit card provider, you’ll receive emails letting you know when our statement is ready, so you
         can review it before the money is automatically transferred out of your current account. This is helpful in case your bill
         unexpectedly exceeds the amount available in your current account&mdash;that way you can adjust the amount you pay that month.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">TWEAKING THE SYSTEM</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">That’s the basic Automatic Money Flow schedule, but you may not be paid on a straight once-a-month schedule. That’s not a
         problem. You can just adjust the above system to match your payment schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">If you’re paid twice a month:</em></strong> I suggest replicating the above system on the 1st and the 15th&mdash;with half the money each time. This is easy enough, but the
         one thing to watch with this is paying your bills. If the second payment (on the 15th) will miss the due dates for any of
         your bills, be sure that you set it so that those bills are paid in full during the payment on the 1st. Another way to work
         your system is to do half the payments with one paycheck (retirement, fixed costs) and half the payments with the second paycheck
         (savings, guilt-free spending), but that can get clunky.

      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span> pay with my credit card as much as possible because it lets me automatically download my transactions and categorize my spending.
         Plus, I get travel points and extra consumer protection, like a free additional warranty for any electronic device (for more
         on this, see <a href="#calibre_link-71">page 31</a>).
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Once a week, I take five minutes and review all the charges on my card, and once a month I get an e-mail to review my entire
         bill. If I take no action, my credit card reaches into my checking account and pays the full amount automatically. No late
         fees, no worries. If I do see an error, I just call my credit card company anytime twenty-four hours a day and get it fixed.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Let’s talk about those weekly reviews for a second. I do like to keep an eye on my credit card charges whenever there’s a
         human involved, so I keep my receipts whenever I go to restaurants, and store them in a folder on my desk.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Every Sunday night, I open the folder and spend about five minutes comparing my receipts with what my credit card’s website
         says. I just do a “ctrl-f” for the amount (for example, $43.35) and confirm that it’s correct. If I wrote down $43.35 as the
         full amount, but instead saw that the restaurant had charged me $50, someone’s trying to make a quick buck off me. And in
         that case, you need to ask yourself one question:

         the Conscious Spending Plan&mdash;you’ll need to figure out how much you need to survive on each month. This is the bare minimum:

      <p class="q"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">When do I get to spend my money?</em></p>
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7">A:</strong> Okay. You’ve got your automatic infrastructure set up. Each month, you’ve got money flowing automatically to your investing
         accounts and savings accounts. You’ve even cut your spending by focusing on a couple of big wins. So when do you get to spend
         all this money?
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">What a great question. The only people who’ve ever asked me this are actually concerned about saving<em class="calibre2"> too much.</em></p>
      <p class="btx1">The answer is simple: Once you’ve gotten your money under control and you’re hitting your targets, you absolutely should spend
         your leftover money. Look to your savings goals. If you don’t have something in there for “vacation” or “new snowboard,” maybe
         you should. Otherwise, what is all this money for?
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Money exists for a reason&mdash;to let you do what you want to do. Yes, it’s true, every pound you spend now would be worth more
         later. But living only for tomorrow is no way to live. Consider one investment that most people overlook: <em class="calibre2">yourself</em>. Think about traveling&mdash;how much will that be worth to you later? Or attend that conference that will expose you to the top
         people in your field. My friend Paul has a specific “networking budget” that he uses to travel to meet interesting people
         each year. If you invest in yourself, the potential return is limitless.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">If you’re meeting your goals, another route you could take is to start saving less and increase the amount you allocate to
         your guilt-free spending money.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">One final thing: I hope this doesn’t sound too cheesy, but one of the best returns I’ve ever gotten has been with philanthropy.
         Whether it’s your time or your money, I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to give back, be it to your own community
         or to the global community. Volunteer your time at a local school or youth organization, or donate painlessly by searching
         the web with 
         <a href="http://www.everyclick.com">www.everyclick.com</a>. Charities get a donation every time you search. For more on giving back, see <a href="#calibre_link-72">page 215</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now, back to the Conscious Spending Plan. Add a savings goal of three months of bare-bones income before you do any investing.
         For example, if you need at least £1,500/month to live on, you’ll need to have £4,500 in a savings buffer, which you can use
         to smooth out months where you don’t generate much income. The buffer should exist as a sub-account in your savings account.
         To fund it, use money from two places: First, forget about investing while you’re setting up the buffer, and instead take
         any money you would have invested and send it to your savings account. Second, in good months, any extra money you make should
         go into your buffer savings.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Once you’ve saved up three months of money as a cushion, congratulations! Now go back to a normal Conscious Spending Plan
         where you send money to investing accounts. Because you’re self-employed, you probably don’t have access to a traditional
         company pension, but you should look into a stakeholder or personal pension, which are great alternatives. Just keep in mind
         that it’s probably wise to sock away a little more into your savings account in good months to make up for the less profitable
         ones.

      <p class="cst"><em class="calibre2">Why professional wine tasters and stock pickers are clueless&mdash;and how you can beat them</em></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00007.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="cotx"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f I invited you to a blind taste test of a $12 wine versus a $1,200 wine, could you tell the difference? I bet you $20 you
         couldn’t.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In 2001, Frederic Brochet, a researcher at the University of Bordeaux, ran a study that sent shock waves through the wine
         industry. Determined to understand how wine drinkers decided which wines they liked, he invited fifty-seven recognized experts
         to evaluate two wines: one red, one white.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">After tasting the two wines, the experts described the red wine as <em class="calibre2">intense, deep,</em> and <em class="calibre2">spicy</em>&mdash;words commonly used to describe red wines. The white was described in equally standard terms: <em class="calibre2">lively, fresh,</em> and <em class="calibre2">floral.</em> But what none of these experts picked up on was that the two wines were <em class="calibre2">exactly the same wine.</em> Even more damning, the wines were actually <em class="calibre2">both</em> white wine&mdash;the “red wine” had been colored with food coloring.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Think about that for a second. Fifty-seven wine experts couldn’t even tell they were drinking two identical wines.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">There’s something we need to talk about when it comes to experts.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Americans love experts. We feel comforted when we see a tall, uniformed pilot behind the controls of a plane. We trust our
         doctors to prescribe the right medications, we’re confident that our lawyers will steer us right through legal tangles, and
         we devour the words of the talking heads in the media. We’re taught that experts deserve to be compensated for their training
         and experience. After all, we wouldn’t hire someone off the street to build a house or remove our wisdom teeth, would we?
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">All our lives, we’ve been taught to defer to experts: teachers, doctors, and investment “professionals.” But ultimately, expertise
         is about results. You can have the fanciest degrees from the fanciest schools, but if you can’t perform what you were hired
         to do, your expertise is meaningless. In our culture of worshipping experts, what have the results been? When it comes to
         finances in America, they’re pretty dismal. We’ve earned failing grades in financial literacy&mdash;in 2008, high school seniors
         correctly answered a gloomy 48 percent of questions on the Jumpstart Coalition’s national financial literacy survey, while
         college seniors answered only 65 percent right. We think “investing” is about guessing the next best stock. Instead of enriching
         ourselves by saving and investing, most American and UK households are in debt. And the wizards of Wall Street can’t even
         manage their own companies’ risk. Something’s not right here: Our financial experts are failing us.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When it comes to investing, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the options: small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks; REITS; bonds;
         growth, value, or balanced funds&mdash;not to mention factoring in expense ratios, interest rates, allocation goals, and diversification.
         That’s why so many people say, “Can’t I just hire someone to do this for me?” This is a maddening question because, in fact,
         financial experts&mdash;in particular, fund managers and anyone who attempts to predict the market&mdash;are often no better than amateurs.
         They’re often <em class="calibre2">worse.</em> The vast majority of twentysomethings can earn more than the so-called “experts” by investing on their own. No financial
         adviser. No fund manager. Just automatic investments in low-cost funds (which I’ll get to in the next chapter). So, for the
         average investor, the value of financial expertise is a myth. There are several reasons for this that I’ll detail below, but
         I urge you to think about how you treat the experts in your life. Do they deserve to be put on a pedestal? Do they deserve
         tens of thousands of your pounds in fees? If so, what kind of performance do you demand of them?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In truth, being rich is within <em class="calibre2">your</em> control, not some expert’s. How rich you are depends on the amount you’re able to save and on your investment plan. But acknowledging
         this fact takes guts, because it means admitting that there’s no one else to blame if you’re not rich&mdash;no advisers, no complicated
         investment strategy, no “market conditions.” But it also means that you control exactly what happens to you and your money
         over the long term.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You know what the most fun part of this book is for me? No, it’s not the personal-finance groupies that I constantly wish
         I had. It’s the disbelieving e-mails I’m going to get after people read this chapter. Whenever I point out how people waste
         their money by investing in expensive actively managed funds or by relying on a financial adviser who generates below-market
         returns, I get e-mails that say, “You’re full of it.” Or they say, “There’s no way that’s true&mdash;just look at my investment
         returns,” not really understanding how much they’ve made after factoring in taxes and fees. But surely they <em class="calibre2">must</em> be making great returns because they wouldn’t continue investing if they weren’t making lots of money… right?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In this chapter, I’m going to show you how you can actually outperform the financial pundits by sidestepping their “expertise”
         (and fees) and taking the simplest approach to investing. It’s not easy to learn that reliance on so-called “experts” is largely
         ineffective, but stick with me. I’ve got the data to back it up, and I’ll show you a simple way to invest on your own.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Experts Can’t Guess Where the Market Is Going</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore we move on to discuss how you can beat the experts, let’s look a little more deeply into how they operate and why their
         advice so often misses the mark.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The most visible financial “experts” are the financial pundits and portfolio managers (the people who choose the specific
         stocks in mutual funds). They love to regale us with their predictions about where the market is going: Up! Down! They go
         on and on about how interest rates and oil production and a butterfly flapping its wings in China will affect the stock market.
         This forecasting is called timing the market. But the truth is they simply cannot predict how high, how low, or even which
         direction the market will go. I get e-mails from people wondering what I think about oil, currency markets, or Google every
         single day. Who knows about those things? I certainly don’t, especially in the short term. Unfortunately, the fact is that
         nobody can predict where the market is going. Still, the talking heads on TV make grandiose predictions every day, and whether
         they’re right or wrong, they’re never held accountable for them.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The media feeds off every little market fluctuation. On one day, the pundits are spreading gloom and doom about a multi-hundred-point
         loss in the market. Then, three days later, the front page is filled with images of hope and unicorns as the market climbs
         500 points. It’s riveting to watch, but step back and ask yourself, “Am I learning anything from this? Or am I just being
         overwhelmed by information about the market going up one day and down another?” More information is not always good, especially
         when it’s not actionable and causes you to make errors in your investing. The key takeaway here is to ignore any predictions
         that pundits make. They simply do not know what will happen in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Even though you’d think they’d know better, fund managers also fall prey to financial hype. You can see this in the trading
         patterns of funds themselves: Some actively managed funds “turn over” stocks frequently, meaning they buy and sell funds a
         lot (incurring trading fees and, if held outside a tax-advantaged account, taxes for you). The managers chase the latest hot
         stock, confident of their abilities to spot something that millions of others have not. What’s more, they also demand extraordinary
         compensation. Get this: In 2006, the average Goldman Sachs employee made $622,000. That’s not a typo&mdash;it’s the <em class="calibre2">average amount</em> Goldman employees made with salary and bonuses. Despite this astronomical compensation, fund managers from all companies
         still fail to beat the market <em class="calibre2">75 percent of the time.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">“But Ramit,” you might say, “my fund is different. The manager returned 80 percent over the last two years!” That’s great,
         but just because someone beat the market for a year or two doesn’t mean they’ll beat the market the next year. Think back
         to the year 2000. If you had looked at the fifty best-returning funds then, exactly zero would have been on the same list
         in 1998 or 1999. And if I asked you to name the best stocks of the past ten years, you might select Apple&mdash;but would you have
         guessed Oshkosh Truck? What about Gilead Sciences? Holly Corp?
      </p>
      
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">More Examples of How “Experts” Can’t Time the Market</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">P</span>undits and television shows know exactly how to get our attention: with flashy graphics, loud talking heads, and bold predictions
         about the market that may or may not (in fact, probably not) come true. These may be entertaining, but let’s look at some
         actual data.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Fidelity International carried out some research between June 1994 and June 2009 and found that the annual return of the FTSE
         All Share index was 6.13 percent. They noted something amazing: During that fifteen-year period, if you missed the best twenty
         days of investing (the days where the stock market gained the most points), your return would have dropped from 6.13 percent
         to 5.31 &ndash; a loss of 0.82 percent. And if you missed the best <em class="calibre2">forty</em> days you would have made an annual loss of 5.05 percent or a loss of 54 percent over the whole period. Unfortunately, we
         can’t know the best investing days ahead of time. The only long-term solution is to invest regularly, putting as much money
         as possible into low-cost, diversified funds, even in an economic downturn.
      </p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">USELESS NEWSLETTERS</small>.</strong> A 1996 study by John Graham and Campbell Harvey investigated more than two hundred market-timing newsletters. The results
         were, shall we say, unimpressive. “We find that the newsletters fail to offer advice consistent with market timing,” the authors
         deadpanned as only academics can. Hilariously, by the end of the 12.5-year period they studied, 94.5 percent of the newsletters
         had gone out of business. Not only did these market-timing newsletters fail to accurately predict what would happen, but they
         couldn’t even keep their own doors open. Get a life, market timers.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">I’ll end with a couple of more recent examples. In December 2007, <em class="calibre2">Fortune</em> published an article called “The Best Stocks for 2008,” which contained a special entry: Merrill Lynch. “Smart investors
         should buy this stock before everyone else comes to their senses,” they advised. They obviously weren’t counting on it being
         sold in a fire sale a few months later. And in April 2008, <em class="calibre2">BusinessWeek</em> advised us, “Don’t be leery of Lehman.” I’m not sure about you guys, but I’m leery of worthless risky advice couched in cute
         alliteration. I think I’ll ignore you from now on, pundits.
      </p>
    </div>
      
      <p class="calibre6">The problem is that nobody can consistently guess which funds or stocks will outperform, or even match, the market over time.
         Anyone who claims they can is lying.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">So ignore the pundits’ predictions. Ignore the last year or two of a fund’s performance. A fund manager may be able to perform
         very well over the short term. But over the long term he will almost never beat the market&mdash;because of expenses, fees, and
         the growing mathematical difficulty of picking outperforming stocks (more on that later in this chapter). When you’re evaluating
         a fund, the only way to really gauge it is by looking at its track record for the last ten years or more.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">How Financial Experts Hide Poor Performance</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s I’ve shown, the “experts” are often wrong and fail to beat the market, but even more irritatingly, they know how to cover
         their tracks so we don’t catch on to their failures. In fact, the financial industry&mdash;including both companies that administer
         actively managed funds and so-called experts&mdash;are sneakier than you’d imagine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">One of the biggest tricks they use is to never admit they were wrong. Daniel Solin, author of <em class="calibre2">The Smartest Investment Book You’ll Ever Read,</em> describes a study that illustrates how financial-ratings companies like Morningstar, which provides stock ratings that investors
         can use to get a quick take on many stocks’ performance, continue to give thumbs-up ratings even as the companies they purport
         to be evaluating crater and lose billions of dollars of shareholder value. (Aside from their stock ratings, they do have an
         excellent website with tools that I use all the time. So it’s not like they’re all bad.) The study found the following:
      </p>
      <p class="ext2"><em class="calibre2">Forty-seven of the fifty [advisory] firms continued to advise investors to buy or hold shares in the companies up to the date
            the companies filed for bankruptcy.</em></p>
      <p class="ext2"><em class="calibre2">Twelve of the nineteen companies continued to receive “buy” or “hold” ratings on the actual date they filed for bankruptcy.</em></p>
            <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Three Legendary Investors Who Prove Me Wrong&mdash;Sort of</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow, there are indeed investors who have beaten the market consistently for years. Warren Buffett, for example, has produced
         a 22 percent annualized return over forty years. Peter Lynch of Fidelity returned 29 percent over thirteen years. And Yale’s
         David Swensen has returned more than 16 percent over twenty-three years. They have phenomenal investing skills and have earned
         their titles as some of the best investors in the world. But just because these guys can consistently beat the market doesn’t
         mean you or I can.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Yes, theoretically, it is possible to consistently beat the market (which typically returns around 8 percent after you account
         for inflation) in the same way it is <em class="calibre2">possible</em> for me to become a heavyweight boxing champion. With millions of people around the globe trying to beat the market, statistically
         there are bound to be a few extreme outliers. Who knows whether their success is due to statistics or skill? But even the
         experts themselves agree that individual investors shouldn’t expect to equal their returns. Swensen, for example, has explained
         that he achieves outsize returns because of top-notch professional resources, but more important, access to investments that
         you and I will never have, such as the very best venture capital and hedge funds, which he can use to bolster his asset allocation.
         Swensen recently told the <em class="calibre2">Financial Post</em> about his resources versus the average investor’s: “I’ve got 20 professionals here in New Haven devoting their careers to
         identifying high-quality active management opportunities,” he said. “An individual who devotes a couple of hours a week in
         the evening, at most, trying to compete with institutions that have armies of people out there? It just doesn’t make sense.”
</p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">Companies like Moody’s and Morningstar offer ratings of stocks and funds that are supposedly simple reflections of their value,
         but the idea of Morningstar’s five-star ratings is actually complete nonsense. Why? For two reasons:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">First, receiving five golden stars doesn’t actually predict success. A 1999 study by researchers Christopher Blake and Matthew
         Morey showed that although the low-star ratings were on target in predicting poor-performing stocks, the high-star ratings
         were not accurate. They wrote: “[F]or the most part, there is little statistical evidence that Morningstar’s highest-rated
         funds outperform the next-to-highest and median-rated fund.” Just because a company assigns five shiny stars to a fund does
         not mean it will perform well.

            <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">A number of mutual-fund management complexes employ the practice of starting “incubator” funds. A complex may start ten small
            new equity funds with different in-house managers and wait to see which ones are successful. Suppose after a few years only
            three funds produce total returns better than the broad-market averages. The complex begins to market those successful funds
            aggressively, dropping the other seven and burying their records.</em></p>
      <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre7">&mdash;<small class="calibre10">BURTON G. MALKIEL, <em class="calibre2">A RANDOM WALK DOWN WALL STREET</em></small></strong></p>
<p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="calibre6">Second, when it comes to fund ratings, companies rely on something called <em class="calibre2">survivorship bias</em> to obscure the picture of how well a company is doing. Survivorship bias exists because funds that fail are not included
         in any future studies of fund performance for the simple reason that they don’t exist anymore. For example, a company may
         start a hundred funds, but have only fifty left a couple of years later. The company can trumpet how effective their fifty
         funds are, but ignore the fifty funds that failed and have been erased from history. In other words, when you see “Best 10
         Funds!” pages on actively managed-fund websites and in magazines, it’s just as important to think about what you <em class="calibre2">aren’t</em> seeing as what you are: The funds on that page are the ones that didn’t close down. Out of that pool of already successful
         funds, <em class="calibre2">of course</em> there will be some five-star funds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Financial companies know very well about survivorship bias, but they care more about having a page full of funds with great
         performance numbers than revealing the whole truth. As a result, they’ve consciously created several ways to test funds quickly
         and market only the best-performing ones, thus ensuring their reputation as the brand with the “best” funds.

      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">How to Engineer a Perfect Stock-Picking Record</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince we know it’s almost impossible to beat the market over the long term, let’s turn to probability and luck to explain why
         some funds seem irresistibly compelling. Although a fund manager might be lucky for one, two, or even three years, it’s mathematically
         unlikely he’ll continue beating the market. To examine probability theory, let’s take a simple example of an unscrupulous
         scammer who wants to sell his financial services to some naive investors.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">He e-mails 10,000 people, half of whom are told that Stock A will go up, the other half Stock B. “This is just a freebie e-mail
         to demonstrate my insider knowledge,” he might say. After a couple of weeks, he notices that Stock A has indeed gone up by
         chance. He eliminates the Stock B group and focuses on the Stock A group, e-mailing them an “I told you so” e-mail. This time,
         he splits the mailing in half again. Twenty-five hundred people are told about Stock C and 2,500 are told about Stock D. If
         either C or D goes up, on the next cycle, at least 1,250 people will have seen him pick two stocks successfully. And each
         cycle will make the recipients increasingly awed by his “ability.”
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Because we like to create order where there is none, we will ascribe magical stock-picking abilities to the scammer&mdash;even though
         it was literally by chance&mdash;and buy whatever “investment success kit” he’s selling. The same is true of the pages of “five-star
         funds” you see. Moral of the story: Don’t trust purported financial expertise just because of a few impressive stats.

      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7">A:</strong> Despite all my criticism of pathetic pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about, there are still people who provide
         a fresh perspective on money issues. Here are three of my favorite bloggers.

      <p class="btx1"><strong class="calibre7">Get Rich Slowly (<a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog">www.getrichslowly.org/blog</a>),</strong> by J. D. Roth, is a great blog covering the basics of personal finance. With a name like that, you can imagine that J. D.
         believes in long-term growth. He writes about managing money, investing, and even starting a side job.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1"><strong class="calibre7">The Simple Dollar (<a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com">www.thesimpledollar.com</a>)</strong> is written by Trent Hamm. He covers the saving, investing, and debt sides of personal finance. He’s got great book reviews

      </p>
      <p class="btx1"><strong class="calibre7">JLP at AllFinancialMatters (<a href="http://allfinancialmatters.com">http://allfinancialmatters.com</a>)</strong> does an excellent job of using charts and data to show how low-cost investing beats brokers. JLP is usually pretty laid back,
         but occasionally he loses it and can’t resist calling out financial companies that take advantage of regular people (those

      <p class="calibre6">These tricks are especially insidious because you’d never know to look out for them. When you see a page full of funds with
         15 percent returns, you naturally assume they’ll keep giving you 15 percent returns in the future. And it’s even better if
         they have five-star ratings from a trusted company like Morningstar. But now that we know about survivorship bias and the
         fact that most ratings are meaningless, it’s easy to see that financial “experts” and companies are just looking to fatten
         their wallets, not ensure that you get the best return for your money.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">I Bet You Don’t Need a Financial Adviser</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou’ve heard my rants against the media hype surrounding investment and the poor performance of most professional investors.
         Now there’s one more category of financial professionals that I want to warn you about: financial advisers.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Some of you might say, “But Ramit, I don’t have time to invest! Can’t I just use a financial adviser?” Ah, yes, the old outsourcing
         argument. We outsource our car cleaning, laundry, and housekeeping. So why not the management of our money?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most young people don’t need a financial adviser. We have such simple needs that with a little bit of time (a few hours a
         week over the course of, say, six weeks) we can get an automatic personal-finance infrastructure working for us.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Plus, financial advisers don’t always look out for your interests. They’re supposed to help you make the right decisions about
         your money, but keep in mind that unless they’re independent, they don’t have to do what’s best for you. Some of them will
         give you very good advice, but many of them are pretty useless. If they’re paid on commission, they will usually direct you
         to expensive, bloated funds to earn their commissions. By contrast, fee-based financial advisers simply charge a flat fee
         and are much more reputable. (Neither is necessarily better at providing good investment returns, or your top line; they simply
         charge differently, affecting your bottom line.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The key takeaway is that most people don’t actually need a financial adviser&mdash;you can do it all on your own and come out ahead.
         But if your choice is between hiring a financial adviser or not investing at all, then sure, you should hire one. People with
         really complex financial situations, those who have inherited significant amounts of money, and those who truly are too busy
         to learn about investing for themselves also should consider seeking an adviser’s help. It’s better to pay a little and get
         started investing than to not start at all. If you’re determined to get professional help, begin your search at the Institute
         of Financial Planning (<a href="http://www.financialplanning.org.uk">www.financialplanning.org.uk</a>). These planners are fee based (either a flat fee or an hourly rate) and are licensed. They want to help you, not profit
         off their recommendations.

      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you really want to look into hiring a financial adviser, here’s an introductory e-mail you can adapt and send:
      </p>
      <p class="lsal">Hi, Mike,</p>
      <p class="l">I’m looking for a fee-based financial planner, and I found you on 
         <a href="http://www.financialplanning.org.uk">www.financialplanning.org.uk</a>. A little bit about me: I’m 29 and have about £15,000 in total assets. At the moment my money is split between a stocks and
         shares ISA and a stakeholder pension, although I also have some cash. I don’t need the money any time soon, so I’m looking
         for investments that will maximize long-term returns while minimizing costs. If you think you can help me, I’d like to meet
         for half an hour and ask you some specific questions. I’d also like to hear details on other situations in which you’ve worked
         with similar people with similar goals. Would next Friday, 2/6, at 2 <span class="calibre10">P.M</span>., work at your office? Alternatively, Monday, 2/9,
         is wide open for me.
      </p>
      <p class="lsig">Thanks, Ramit</p>
      <p class="p1">For your thirty-minute meeting&mdash;which shouldn’t cost you anything&mdash; you’ll want to come prepared with questions. There are hundreds
         of sample questions available online (search for “financial adviser questions”), but at the very least, ask these three:
      </p>
      <p class="bl1a1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you make your money? Is it through commission or strictly fee based? Are there any other fees? <em class="calibre2">(You want a fee-based adviser with no hidden fees.)</em></p>
      <p class="bl1a1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you worked with other people like me in similar situations? What general solutions did you recommend? <em class="calibre2">(Get references and call them.)</em></p>
      <p class="bl1a1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s your working style? Do we talk regularly or do I work with an assistant? <em class="calibre2">(You want to know what to expect in the first thirty days, sixty days, and ninety days.)</em></p>
    </div>
      <p class="calibre6">But remember, many people use financial advisers as a crutch and end up paying tens of thousands of pounds over their lifetime
         simply because they didn’t spend a few hours learning about investing. If you don’t learn to manage your money in your twenties,
         you’ll cost yourself a ton one way or another&mdash;whether you do nothing, or pay someone exorbitant fees to “manage” your money.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Active vs. Passive Management</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">P</span>lease know that even with all of this doom and gloom about professional investor performance, I’m not in any way saying that
         investing is a waste of money. You just have to know where to invest.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Actively managed funds&mdash;which are simply collections of stocks (and sometimes bonds, but usually just stocks)&mdash;are often considered
         the simplest and best way for most people to invest. But, as we’ve seen, fund managers fail to beat the market 75 percent
         of the time, and it can be hard to tell which funds will actually perform well over the long term. And no matter how good
         an actively managed fund is, the returns are hampered by the large fees they charge. (Sure, there are some low-cost actively
         managed funds, but because of the way they compensate their own portfolio managers and other employees, it’s virtually impossible
         for them to compete with the low costs of passively managed tracker funds, which I’ll talk more about in a minute.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When it comes to investing, fees are a huge drag on your returns. This is a little counterintuitive since we’re used to paying
         for service, like our gym membership or admission to Disneyland. If we’re getting something out of it, we should pay a fair
         price, right? The key is <em class="calibre2">fair,</em> and many of the financial “experts” we turn to for guidance make an effort to squeeze every last cent out of us.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">You see, actively managed funds employ a fund manager (or sometimes a whole team to actively try and pick the best stocks
         and give you the best return. Sounds good, right? But even with all the fancy analysts and technology they employ, portfolio
         managers still make fundamentally human mistakes like selling too quickly, trading too much, and making rash guesses. These
         fund managers trade frequently so they can show short-term results to their shareholders and prove they’re doing something&mdash;anything!&mdash;to
         earn your money. Not only do they usually fail to beat the market, but they charge a fee to do this. Actively managed funds
         typically charge 1.5 to 2 percent of assets managed each year. (This percentage is known as the annual management charge.)
         In other words, with a 2 percent expense ratio and a £10,000 portfolio, you’d pay £200 per year in fees. Some funds even tack
         on additional sales charges, or “loads,” to the purchase price (called an initial charge) or sales price (back-end load) of
         the fund. These are just some of the tricky ways actively managed fund managers make money whether they perform or not.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Two percent doesn’t sound like much until you compare it with the alternative: “passive management.” This is how tracker funds
         (a cousin of actively managed funds) are run. These funds work by replacing portfolio managers with computers. The computers
         don’t attempt to find the hottest stock. They simply and methodically pick the same stocks that an index holds&mdash;for example,
         the 350 stocks in the FTSE 350 index&mdash;in an attempt to match the market. (An index is a way to measure part of the stock market.
         For example, the FTSE 100 represents the UK’s 100 largest publicly-owned companies; other UK indexes track technology companies
         or smaller businesses. There are international indexes and even retail indexes.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most tracker funds stay close to the market (or to the segment of the market they represent). Just as the stock market may
         fall 10 percent one year and gain 18 percent the next year, tracker funds will rise and fall with the indexes they track.
         The big difference is in fees: Tracker funds are not as cheap in the UK as they are in the US, but that is beginning to change
         and you can get trackers that charge less than 0.25 percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-53"></a>Remember, there are all kinds of tracker funds. International tracker funds are relatively volatile since they follow indexes
         that were just recently established. General U.S.-based tracker funds, on the other hand, are more reliable. Since they match
         the U.S. stock market, if the market goes down, tracker funds will also go down. During the financial crisis, many tracker
         funds plummeted as they matched the market, which underwent a global drop. But over the long term, the overall stock market
         has consistently returned about 8 percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let’s look at the performance from two sides: the downside (fees) and the upside (returns). First, let’s compare the fees
         for a passively managed fund with those for an actively managed fund.

      </table>
      <p class="calibre6">If your decision was determined by fees alone, tracker funds would be the clear choice. But let’s also consider another important
         factor: returns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Despite my hammering home the fact that actively managed funds fail to beat the market 75 percent of the time, I will say
         that they do occasionally provide great returns. In some years, some actively managed funds do extraordinarily well and far
         outperform tracker funds. In a good year, for example, a fund focused on Russian stocks might return 70 percent&mdash;but one or
         two years of great performance only gets you so far. What you really want is solid, long-term returns. So, if you’re thinking
         about using a broker or actively managed fund, call them and ask them a simple, point-blank question: “What were your after-tax,
         after-fee returns for the last ten, fifteen, and twenty years?” Yes, their response must include all fees and taxes. Yes,
         the return must be at least ten years, because the last five years of any time period are too volatile to matter. And yes,
         I promise they won’t give you a straight answer, because that would be admitting that they didn’t beat the market consistently.
         It’s <em class="calibre2">that</em> hard to do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">So, the safe assumption is that actively managed funds will too often fail to beat or match the market. In other words, if
         the market returns 8 percent, actively managed funds won’t return at least 8 percent more than three-fourths of the time.
         In addition, when combined with their high expense ratios, actively managed funds have to outperform cheaper, passively managed
         funds by at least 2 or 3 percent just to break even with them&mdash;and that simply doesn’t happen.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In his book <em class="calibre2">The Smartest Investment Book You’ll Ever Read,</em> Daniel Solin cites a study conducted by Professor Edward S. O’Neal from the Babcock Graduate School of Management. O’Neal
         tracked funds whose sole purpose was to beat the market. What he discovered was that from 1993 through 1998, less than half
         of these actively managed funds beat the market. And from 1998 through 2003, only 8 percent beat the market. But there’s more.
         When he looked at the number of funds that beat the market in <em class="calibre2">both</em> time periods, the results were “sad indeed. The number of funds that beat the market in both periods was a whopping ten&mdash;or
         only 2 percent of all large-cap funds… Investors, both individual and institutional, and particularly pension plans, would
         be far better served by investing in passive or passively managed funds than in trying to pick more expensive active managers
         who purport to be able to beat the markets.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Bottom line: There’s no reason to pay exorbitant fees for active management when you could do better, for cheaper, on your
         own.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now that you’ve read about the myth of expertise, it’s time to see exactly how you can invest your own money to get better
         returns for lower cost. In the next chapter, I’ll teach you everything you need to know about investing, and we’ll cover all

         someone boasts, “I have £50,000 in my portfolio,” which they would say only if they were a jackass, they’re probably referring
         to money in their pension funds, and perhaps even other investment accounts.) By the end of this chapter, you’ll know exactly
         what to invest in&mdash;and why. And you’ll do it with minimal human involvement, incurring minimal expense.

      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7">IF YOU CHOSE MOSTLY (A),</strong> you’re a type-A power investor who’s focused on the long term. You’re willing to give up convenience in exchange for control over every aspect of your portfolio. I recommend you pick your own asset allocation through tracker funds. See how on <a href="#calibre_link-48">page 188</a>.</p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7">IF YOU CHOSE MOSTLY (B)S,</strong> you’re like most people reading this book: You don’t need your money for the next few years, but after that, it’s hard to tell what you’ll need. You know you should do <em class="calibre2">something</em> to invest but it’s not clear what&mdash;and you don’t want to spend your life managing your money. This is actually a great position to be in because, while most people will give in to inertia and do nothing, you can take action. You’re a perfect candidate for the 85 Percent Solution: You just want to invest and let your money grow without having to think about or monitor it all the time. I recommend a lifecycle fund for your pension (or a multi-asset fund as an alternative to a tracker if it’s an ISA).</p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7">IF YOU CHOSE MOSTLY (C)S,</strong> you need to get your head on straight. It’s one thing to be conservative&mdash;if you’re afraid of losing money, you can pick investments that limit your exposure (such as a lifecycle fund that’s geared towards cautious investors, or a heavier emphasis on more stable, large-cap funds in your portfolio). But the more common problem is that you haven’t given investing much thought at all! You want to invest and get your money out in three to five years? What the hell is wrong with you? Nobody can consistently make money in the short term.</p>
      <p class="btx1">More typically, people who answered (c) haven’t invested at all. Confusion and fear of losing money gets in the way. Let’s be clear: If you’re not investing, in the long term you’re losing money every day. It actually costs you money to park your money in a savings account as inflation eats into your earnings. Look at the chart on <a href="#calibre_link-49">page 5</a> to see why investing makes such a difference&mdash;especially when you start early. If you’re truly risk-averse, you can always balance your portfolio with more conservative investments. But don’t succumb to irrational fear and not invest at all. Ironically, the people who do that are the ones who end up without enough money in the end. Check out the chart on <a href="#calibre_link-50">page 75</a> and see why it pays to start investing today.</p>
  </div>
      <p class="calibre6">My goal for this chapter is to help you pick the simplest investment to get started&mdash;and to make your portfolio easy to maintain.
         By doing just those two things, you’ll be on the way to getting rich. Another benefit is that you will, quite simply, become
         a cooler person than all of your friends. Hey, I can’t deny it. You’ll realize that your friend who makes £50,000 a year has
         no savings or investments. You’ll start noticing the excuses people make to justify not investing, including “I don’t have
         time” and “Stocks can go down, and I don’t want to lose my money.” Most people don’t know the first thing about how to pick
         investments&mdash; but now you will! Ah, the Promised Land is sweet.

      <h1 class="calibre11">A Better Way to Invest: Automatic Investing</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">L</span>et’s be honest. Nobody really loves managing their money. I’d rather be <em class="calibre2">using</em> my money, like eating at Taco Bell or flying to New York to hang out with friends. Basically, I’m always on the lookout for
         ways to spend less time and get better results. When I was in high school and applying to colleges, for example, I created
         a system to write three scholarship applications per day and ended up winning more than $200,000 in six months to pay for
         school. These days, I manage more than seven hundred e-mails per day about PBwiki, my blog, and this book. This isn’t to brag
         about how busy I am, but to show that when it comes to money, I’m very, very interested in paying less attention while getting
         better returns. I’ve taken pains to research investments that don’t take lots of time to maintain and also pay off. That’s
         why I urge you to combine a classic low-cost investing strategy with automation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Automatic Investing is not some revolutionary technique that I just invented. It’s a simple way of investing in low-cost funds
         that is recommended by Nobel laureates, billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, and most academics. It involves spending
         most of your time choosing how your money will be distributed in your portfolio, picking the investments (this actually takes
         the least amount of time), and then automating your regular investments so you can sit and watch TV while growing your money.
         Hey, we’re lazy. We might as well embrace it and use it to our advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Automatic Investing works for two reasons:</p>
          <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">LOWER EXPENSES</small>.</strong> As I discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>, nothing kills your investment performance more than expensive funds that invisibly drain your
         returns. Investing in them is especially ridiculous when you can earn better returns with lower fees. Why would you pay for
         the privilege of losing your money? With Automatic Investing, you invest in low-cost funds&mdash;which replace worthless, expensive
         portfolio managers&mdash;and you save tens of thousands of pounds in trading fees, taxes, and overall investment expenses, outperforming
         most investors.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">IT’S AUTOMATIC</small>.</strong> Automatic Investing frees you from having to pay attention to the latest “hot stock” or micro-change in the market. You pick
         a simple investment plan that doesn’t involve any sexy stocks or guessing whether the market is going up or down, and then
         set up automatic contributions to your investment accounts. In this way, you effectively trick yourself into investing because
         it requires no work from you. This means you can focus on living your life&mdash;doing your job well, spending time with friends,
         traveling to different countries, eating at great restaurants&mdash;instead of worrying about your money. I might well call this
         Zen Investing for People Who Have Real Lives. (And that is why I’ll never be a naming consultant.)
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE</small>?</strong> The way I described Automatic Investing was basically the same as saying, “Puppies are cute.” Nobody would ever disagree
         with it. Automatic Investing sounds perfect, but what happens when the market goes down? It’s not as easy to go along for
         the ride then. For example, I know several people who had automatic investment plans and when the stock market incurred huge
         losses in late 2008, they immediately canceled their investments and took their money out of the market. Big mistake. The
         test of a real Automatic Investor is not when things are going up, but when they are going down. It takes strength to know
         that you’re basically getting shares on sale&mdash;and, if you’re investing for the long term, the best time to make money is when
         everyone else is getting out of the market.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Do You Believe Everything Your Friends Tell You?</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="q"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">My friends tell me that investing is too risky and that I could lose all my money. Is that true?</em></p>
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7">A:</strong> That’s an instinctive, emotional reaction, not a well-reasoned, logical response. But you have to admit: It does make sense
         to be scared of investing right now, especially if you don’t understand how it works. With headlines screaming about sharp
         drops, it’s easy to practice the “DNA” style of investing&mdash;the Do Nothing Approach. It’s very unfortunate that the very same
         people who are afraid of investing in the market right now are usually the same people who buy when prices are soaring. As
         Warren Buffett has said, investors should “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">For you, it’s different. You understand how investing works, so you can put a long-term perspective into practice. Yes, in
         theory it’s possible for you to lose all your money, but if you’ve bought different investments to create a balanced (or “diversified”)
         portfolio, you won’t.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">You’ll notice that your friends are concerned with the downside: “You could lose everything! How will you have time to learn
         to invest? There are so many sharks out there to take your money.”
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">What about the downside of the money they’re losing every day by not investing?</p>
      <p class="btx1">Ask your friends what the average return of the S&amp;P 500 has been for the past seventy years. How much money would they have
         if they invested $10,000 today and didn’t touch it for ten years&mdash;or fifty years? They won’t know because they don’t even know
         the basic return rate to assume (try 8 percent). When people say investing is too risky, it’s because they don’t know what
         they don’t know.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BOTTOM LINE</small>:</strong> Automatic Investing may not seem as sexy as trading in hedge funds and biotech stocks, but it works a lot better. Again,
         would you rather be sexy or rich?
      </p>

         more advanced version. If you’re the kind of person who wants your money to grow with the least possible effort on your part

         control&mdash;read on. I’ll walk you through the building blocks of a portfolio, and I’ll help you construct a portfolio that’s
         both aggressive and balanced.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Investing Is Not About Picking Stocks</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">R</span>eally, it’s not. Ask your friends what they think investing means and I bet they’ll say, “Picking stocks.” Guys, you cannot
         reliably pick stocks that will outperform the market over the long term. It’s way too easy to make mistakes such as being
       overconfident about choices or panicking when your investments drop even a little. As we saw in <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>, even experts can’t
         guess what will happen to the stock market. Because they’ve heard it repeatedly from the many investment magazines and TV
         shows, people think that investing is about picking winning stocks and that anyone can be successful. They can’t. I hate to
         say it, but not everyone is a winner. In fact, most of these so-called financial “experts” are failures.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Actually, I don’t hate saying that. I’ll say that to their faces again and again. Yeah, I’m a frail Indian man throwing verbal
         punches here on <a href="#calibre_link-52">page 165</a> of a personal-finance book. This is how battles should be fought.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Anyway, the little-known but true fact is that the major predictor of your portfolio’s volatility is not due, as most people
         think, to the individual stocks you pick, but instead your <em class="calibre2">mix</em> of stocks and bonds. In 1986, researchers Gary Brinson, Randolph Hood, and Gilbert Beebower published a study in the <em class="calibre2">Financial Analysts Journal</em> that rocked the financial world. They demonstrated that more than 90 percent of your portfolio’s volatility is a result of
         your asset allocation. I know <em class="calibre2">asset allocation</em> sounds like a B.S. phrase&mdash;like <em class="calibre2">mission statement</em> and <em class="calibre2">strategic alliance.</em> But it’s not. Asset allocation is your plan for investing, the way you organize the investments in your portfolio between
         stocks, bonds, and cash. In other words, by diversifying your investments across different asset classes (like stocks and
         bonds, or, better yet, stock funds and bond funds), you could control the risk in your portfolio&mdash;and therefore control how
         much money, on average, you’d lose due to volatility. It turns out that the amounts you buy&mdash;whether it’s 100 percent stocks
         or 90 percent stocks and 10 percent bonds&mdash;make a profound difference on your returns. Later, other researchers tried to measure
         how closely <em class="calibre2">volatility</em> and <em class="calibre2">returns</em> were correlated, but the answer ends up being pretty complicated. Suffice it to say that asset allocation is the most significant
         part of your portfolio that you can control.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Think about that remarkable fact: <em class="calibre2">Your investment plan is more important than your actual investments.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Take, for example, this book. If we apply the same principle here, it means that the way I organized this book is more important
         than any given word in it. That makes sense, right? Well, the same is true of investing. If you allocate your money properly&mdash;for
         example, not all in one stock, but spread out across different kinds of funds&mdash;you won’t have to worry about a single stock
         possibly cutting your portfolio’s value in half. Indeed, by diversifying your investments, you’ll make more money as an individual
         investor. To know how to allocate your assets, you have to know the basic options you have for investing, which is where we’re
         headed next.
      </p>
      <p class="line">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“Since you cannot successfully time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of
            your investment strategy, because it is the only factor affecting your investment risk and return that you can control.”</em></p>

      </p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">THE PYRAMID OF INVESTING OPTIONS</strong></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00023.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="calibre6">This Pyramid of Investing Options represents your choices for different investments. At the bottom is the most basic level,
         where you can invest in stocks or bonds or just hold your money in cash. I’m oversimplifying because there are tons of different
         kinds of stocks and bonds, but you get the idea. Above them are tracker and actively managed funds. And finally, at the top
         of the pyramid, are lifestyle funds. Let’s look at each category (also known as <em class="calibre2">asset class</em>) to see what lies beneath.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">STOCKS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">When you buy stock, you buy shares of a company. If the company does well, you expect your stock in it to do well. When people
         talk about “the market,” they’re talking about a collection of thirty large-cap stocks&mdash;the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.
         The S&amp;P 500 is another index of 500 stocks that I’ll frequently refer to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Overall, stocks as an entire category provide excellent returns. As we know, on average the stock market returns about 8 percent
         per year. In fact, you can do significantly better than the market if you pick a winning stock&mdash;or significantly worse if you
         pick a loser. Although stocks as a whole provide generally excellent returns, individual stocks are less clear. If you invest
         all your money in one stock, for example, you <em class="calibre2">might</em> make a huge return, but it’s also possible the company could tank and you could lose it all.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Stocks have been a good way to earn significant returns over the long term, but I discourage you from picking individual stocks,
         because it’s extremely difficult to choose winning ones on your own. The tricky thing about stocks is you never know what
         will happen. For example, in 2005 eBay announced that it missed Wall Street’s earning expectations by <em class="calibre2">a penny</em> per share. The stock immediately plunged 20 percent. Was it 20 percent less useful the next day? Of course not.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>, I demonstrated that even professionals whose livelihoods depend on it can’t predict stock returns. And remember,
         these are highly trained analysts who can read stock prospectuses like I can read an Indian restaurant menu&mdash;flawlessly. If
         these experts&mdash;who devour annual reports and understand complicated balance sheets&mdash;can’t beat the market, what chance do you
         have of picking stocks that will go up?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You have very little chance. That’s why individual investors like you and me should not invest in individual stocks. Instead,
         we’ll choose funds, which are collections of stocks (and sometimes, for diversification, bonds). They let you reduce your
         risk and create a well-balanced portfolio that will let you sleep at night… but more on that later.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">BONDS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Bonds are essentially IOUs from companies or the government. (Technically, bonds are longer-term investments of ten-plus years,
         whereas fixed-rate bonds involve lending money to a bank. Because they’re very similar, let’s just call them both <em class="calibre2">bonds</em> to simplify things.) If you buy a one-year bond, it’s the same as if the bank says, “Hey, if you lend us £100, we’ll give
         you £103 back a year from now.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The advantages of bonds are that you can choose the term, or length of time, you want the loan to last (two years, five years,
         ten years, and so on), and you know exactly how much you’ll get when they “mature” or pay out. Also, bonds, especially government
         bonds, are generally stable and let you decrease the risk in your portfolio (UK government bonds, which are seen as very safe,
         are called gilts). See, the only way you’d lose money on a government bond is if the government defaulted on its loans&mdash;and
         it doesn’t do that. If it runs low on money, it just prints more of it. Now <em class="calibre2">that’s</em> gangsta.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">But because bonds are such a safe, low-risk investment, the return&mdash;even on a highly rated bond&mdash;is much lower than it would
         be on an excellent stock. Investing in bonds also renders your money illiquid, meaning it’s locked away and inaccessible for
         a set period of time. Technically, you can withdraw early, but you’ll face severe penalties, so it’s a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">With these qualities, what kind of person would invest in bonds? Let’s see: extremely stable, essentially guaranteed rate
         of return, but relatively small returns… Who would it be?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In general, rich people and old people like bonds. Old people like them because they like to know exactly how much money they’re
         getting next month for their medication or whatever it is they need. Also, some of these grannies and grampies can’t withstand
         the volatility of the stock market because they don’t have much other income to support themselves and/or they have very little
         time left on this earth to recover from any downturn.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Rich people, on the other hand, tend to become more conservative because they have so much money. Put it this way: When you
         have £10,000, you want to invest aggressively to grow it because you want to make more money. But when you have £10 million,
         your goals switch from aggressive growth to preservation of capital. You’ll accept lower investment returns in exchange for
         security and safety. So a guaranteed bond at 3 percent or 4 percent is attractive to a wealthy person&mdash;after all, 3 percent
         of £10 million is still a lot.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><a id="calibre_link-24"></a><strong class="calibre7">CASH</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">In investing terms, cash is money that’s sitting on the sidelines, uninvested and earning only a little money in interest
         from money-market accounts. Be aware that some ‘cash-based’ funds have invested in some complex and risky financial instruments,
         and have been riskier than investors realised. Traditionally, cash has been the third part of a portfolio beyond stocks and
         bonds. You want to have totally liquid cash on hand for emergencies, and as a hedge if the market tanks. Cash is the safest
         part of your portfolio, but it offers the lowest reward. If you factor in inflation, you actually <em class="calibre2">lose</em> money by holding cash in most accounts.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s why I say it’s <em class="calibre2">traditionally</em> been part of a portfolio. As long as you’re contributing toward your savings goals as I described in <a href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter 5</a>, you’re fine.
         Don’t worry about having a separate cash account as part of your investments. Let’s keep this simple.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you bought all different kinds of stocks or stock funds, you’d be diversified&mdash;but still only within stocks. That’s like

      <p class="calibre6">It is important to diversify within stocks, but it’s even more important to allocate <em class="calibre2">across</em> the different asset classes&mdash;like stocks and bonds. Investing in only one category is dangerous over the long term. This is

Remember it like this: Diversification is <em class="calibre2">D</em> for going <em class="calibre2">deep</em> into a category (for example, buying different types of stocks: large-cap, small-cap, international, and so on), and asset
         allocation is <em class="calibre2">A</em> for going <em class="calibre2">across</em> all categories (for example, stocks <em class="calibre2">and</em> bonds).

      <p class="calibre6">In determining where to allocate your assets, one of the most important considerations is the returns each category offers.
         Of course, based on the different types of investments you make, you can expect different returns. Higher risk generally equals
         higher potential for reward. Take a look at the chart above.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">At first glance, it seems clear that stocks return the most. So let’s all invest there!!</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Not so fast. Remember, higher rewards entail higher risk, so if you’re loaded up on stocks and your portfolio dips 25 percent
         next year, all of a sudden you’re financially immobile, eating only Pot Noodle, waiting to see whether your money climbs back
         up or you die first. Hey, it had to be said.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But seriously, many of the fifty- and sixty-year-olds who have seen catastrophic drops in their portfolios should never have
         invested in all equities. Timing matters. If you’re twenty-five years old and have dozens of years to grow your money, a portfolio
         made up of stock-based funds probably makes sense. But if you’re older retirement is coming up within a few decades and you’ll
         want to tamp down your risk. I heard from tons of people in their forties, fifties, and sixties who were rocked by the stock
         market’s decline in 2008. I can’t help but feel sorry for them, but you should learn from their mistakes. Even if the market
         tanks, you have control over your asset allocation. If you’re older&mdash;especially if you’re in your sixties, for god’s sake&mdash;a
         sizeable portion of your portfolio should be in stable bonds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Bonds act as a counterweight to stocks, rising when stocks fall and reducing the overall risk of your portfolio. By investing
         part of your money in bonds, you reduce some of your overall risk. Sure, if that biotech stock went up 200 percent, you’d
         wish your bond money was all in the stock&mdash;but if the stock went down, you’d be glad your bonds were there as a buffer against
         losing everything. Although it may seem counterintuitive, your portfolio will actually have better overall performance if
         you add bonds to the mix. Because bonds will generally perform better when stocks fall, bonds lower your risk a lot while
         limiting your returns only a little.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">“But Ramit,” you might say, “I’m young and I want to invest aggressively. I don’t need bonds.” I agree. Bonds aren’t really
         for young people in their twenties. If you’re in your twenties or early thirties, and you don’t necessarily need to reduce
         your risk, you can simply invest in share-only funds and let time mitigate any risk. But in your thirties and older, you’ll
         want to begin balancing your portfolio with bonds to reduce risk. And what if stocks as a whole don’t perform well for a long
         time? That’s when you need to own other asset classes&mdash;to offset the bad times.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Importance of Being Diversified</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow that we know the basics of the asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash) at the bottom of the pyramid, let’s explore the
         different choices within each asset class. Basically, there are many types of stocks, and we need to own a little of all of
         them. Same with bonds. This is called diversifying, and it essentially means digging in to each asset class&mdash;stocks and bonds&mdash;and
         investing in all their subcategories.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As the table on the next page shows, the broad category of “stocks” actually includes many different kinds of stock, including
         large-company stocks (“large-cap”), mid-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, and international stocks. To add yet another wrinkle,
         none of them performs consistently. In the same year, small-cap stocks might gain huge percentages, but international stocks
         might tank&mdash;and this performance can vary from year to year. For example, William Bernstein notes, in 1998 U.S. large-cap stocks
         gained 28.6 percent, international stocks gained 20 percent, and REITs (collections of real estate stocks) lost 17 percent.
         But in 2000, just two years later, U.S. large-cap stocks <em class="calibre2">lost</em> 9.10 percent, foreign stocks <em class="calibre2">lost</em> 14.17 percent, and REITS <em class="calibre2">gained</em> 31.04 percent. Similarly, different types of bonds offer different benefits, including rates of return and tax advantages.

      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">WHAT A GRANNY NEEDS: TYPICAL ASSET ALLOCATIONS BY AGE</strong></p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7">Here’s what typical investors’ asset allocations&mdash;remember, that’s the mix of different investments&mdash;might look like as they
            get older. These figures are taken from Vanguard’s lifecycle funds.</strong></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00018.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">The fact that performance varies so much in each asset class means two things: First, if you’re trying to make quick money
         off investing, you’ll usually lose money because you have no idea what will happen in the near future. Anyone who tells you
         they do is a fool or a commission-based salesman. Second, you should own different categories of stocks (and maybe bonds)
         to balance out your portfolio. You don’t want to own only U.S. small-cap stocks, for example, or funds that own only small-cap
         stocks. If they didn’t perform well for ten years, that would really suck. If, however, you own small-cap stocks, plus large-cap
         stocks, plus international stocks, and more, you’re effectively insured against any one area dragging you down. So, if you
         were to invest in stocks, you’d want to <em class="calibre2">diversify,</em> buying all different types of stocks or stock funds to have a balanced portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">These allocations are just general rules of thumb. Some people prefer to have 100 percent in stocks until they’re in their
         thirties or forties. Others are more conservative and want some money in bonds. But the big takeaway here is that, if we’re
         in our twenties and thirties, we can afford to be aggressive about investing in stocks and stock funds&mdash;even if they drop temporarily&mdash;because
         time is on our side.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">And honestly, if you’re twenty-five and just starting out, your biggest danger isn’t having a portfolio that’s too risky.
         It’s being lazy and overwhelmed and not doing any investing at all. That’s why it’s important to understand the basics but
         not get too wrapped up in all the variables and choices.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Over time, you can manage your asset allocation to reduce risk and get a fairly predictable return on investments. Thirty
         years from now, you’re going to need to invest very differently from how you do today. That’s just natural: You invest much
         more aggressively in your twenties than in your fifties, as you get older and tell long-winded stories about yourself. So
         although it seems sexy to pull out a pipe and phone in your favorite stock choices to your broker, the real work in investing
         comes with creating an investment plan that’s appropriate for your age and comfort level with risk.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">All of this sounds completely reasonable: “I invest more aggressively when I’m younger, and as I get older, I get more and
         more conservative.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">There’s just one problem.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">How the hell are you actually supposed to do it? What specific investments should you choose? Should you invest in individual
         stocks? (No.) Most people stop here, superficially thinking that investing is only about stocks, leading to frustration. Not
         surprisingly, when they try to think more deeply about this, they get confused and shut down, killing any impetus to invest,
         becoming destitute and wandering around a tumbleweed-laden desert in their twilight years. Well, almost all of that.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Don’t let this happen to you! Let’s go further up the Pyramid of Investing Options to cover another key to investing: funds.</p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Actively Managed Funds: Not Bad, Pretty Convenient, but Often Expensive and Unreliable</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he financial industry isn’t stupid. Those people are ingenious at creating products to meet investor needs (or what the industry
         <em class="calibre2">wants</em> people to need). The first investment fund was launched in 1931. It was just a basket of around two dozen stocks. Instead
         of requiring investors to perform the Herculean task of picking individual stocks themselves, actively managed funds allowed
         average investors to simply choose types of funds that would suit them. For example, there are large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap
         actively managed funds, but also actively managed funds that focus on biotechnology, communication, and even Europe or Asia.
         Actively managed funds are extremely popular because they allow you to pick one fund, which contains different stocks, and
         not worry about putting too many eggs in one basket (as you likely would if you bought individual stocks), monitoring prospectuses,
         or keeping up with industry news. The funds provide instant diversification because they hold many different stocks. Most
         people’s first encounter with actively managed funds is through their pension, where they choose from a bewildering array
         of options. You buy shares of the fund and the fund’s manager picks the stocks he thinks will yield the best return.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Actively managed funds are incredibly useful financial tools&mdash;over the past eighty-five years, they have proven to be very
         popular and extremely profitable. Compared with other investments, they’ve been a cash cow for Wall Street. That’s because
         in exchange for “active management” (having an expert choose a fund’s stocks), the financial companies charge big fat fees
         (also known as annual management charges). These fees eat a hole in your returns and make me want to poke a steel-tipped ice-lolly
         stick into my eye. Sure, there are some low-fee funds out there, but most actively managed funds have high expense ratios.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You can avoid the charges associated with actively managed funds by putting money into an investment trust, rather than a
         unit trust or OEIC. Investment trusts are sold as shares (rather than ‘units’) and they have lower annual management charges
         and no initial charge; although you do pay stamp duty when you buy. The downside is they can be riskier because managers are
         allowed to borrow against their value (called ‘gearing’) and the shares can trade at a discount or premium to the value of
         the trust.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Advantages of a managed fund:</em></strong> Hands-off approach means an expert money manager makes investment decisions for you. Managed funds hold many varied stocks,
         so if one company tanks, your fund doesn’t go down with it.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Disadvantages:</em></strong> Annual fees can equal tens of thousands of pounds or more over the lifetime of an investment using expense ratios, front-end
         loads (worthless sales charges that add nothing to your returns)&mdash;all tricky ways to make managed funds more money. Also, if
         you invest in two managed funds, they may overlap in investments, meaning you may not really be diversified. Worst of all,
         you’re paying an “expert” to manage your money, and 75 percent of them do not beat the market.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In short, actively managed funds are prevalent because of their convenience, but because actively managed funds are, by definition,
         expensive, they’re not the best investment any more. Active management can’t compete with passive management, which takes
         us to tracker funds, the more attractive cousin of managed funds.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Tracker Funds: The Attractive Cousin in an Otherwise Unattractive Family</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n 1975, John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, introduced the world’s first tracker fund. These simple funds use computers to
         buy stocks and match the market (such as the S&amp;P 500 or NASDAQ). Instead of having an actively managed fund’s expensive staff
         of “experts” who try to beat the market, tracker funds set a lower bar: A computer matches the indexes by automatically matching
         the makeup of the market. For example, if a stock represents 2 percent of the S&amp;P 500, it will represent 2 percent of the
         tracker fund. Tracker funds are the financial equivalent of “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” And they do so while also being
         low cost and tax efficient, and requiring hardly any maintenance at all. In other words, tracker funds are simply collections
         of stocks that computers manage in an effort to match the market. There are tracker funds for the S&amp;P 500, for Asia-Pacific
         funds, for real-estate funds, and for anything else you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In a radical move he originally crafted in his senior thesis at Princeton, Bogle argued that tracker funds would offer better
         performance to individual investors. Actively managed fund managers could not typically beat the market, yet they charged
         investors maintenance fees and incurred tremendous amounts of taxes on their frequent trading.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Just as we each think we’re above average when it comes to being attractive, every actively managed fund manager believes
         <em class="calibre2">he</em> can beat the market. To accomplish this, managers use fancy analysis and data, and trade frequently. Ironically, this results
         in lots of taxes and trading fees, which, when combined with the expense ratio, makes it virtually impossible for the average
         fund investor to beat&mdash;or even match&mdash;the market over time. Bogle opted to discard the old model of actively managed funds and
         introduce tracker funds.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Today, tracker funds are an easy, efficient way to make a significant amount of money. Note, however, that tracker funds simply
         match the market. If you own all equities in your twenties (like me) and the stock market drops (like it has), your investments
         will drop (like mine, and everyone else’s, did). Tracker funds reflect the market, which is going through tough times but,
         as history has shown, will climb back up. As a bonus for using tracker funds, you’ll anger your friends in finance because
         you’ll be throwing up your middle finger to their entire industry&mdash;and you’ll keep their fees for yourself. Wall Street is
         terrified of tracker funds and tries to keep them under wraps with increased marketing of actively managed funds and nonsense
         like “5-Star Funds” and TV shows that highlight action, not results.

      <p class="spb"><a id="calibre_link-51"></a><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Advantages of the tracker Fund:</em></strong> Extremely low cost, easy to maintain, and tax efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Disadvantages:</em></strong> When you’re investing in tracker funds, you typically have to invest in multiple funds to create a comprehensive asset allocation
         (although owning just one is better than doing nothing). If you do purchase multiple tracker funds, you’ll have to rebalance
         (or adjust your investments to maintain your target asset allocation) regularly, usually every twelve to eighteen months.
         Each fund typically requires a minimum investment, which is reduced to between £20 and £50 with automatic monthly investments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Okay, so tracker funds are clearly far superior to buying either individual stocks and bonds or actively managed funds. With
         their low fees, they are a great choice if you want to create and control the exact makeup of your portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But what if you’re one of those people who knows you’ll just never get around to doing the necessary research to figure out
         an appropriate asset allocation and which tracker funds to buy? Let’s be honest: Most people don’t want to construct a diversified
         portfolio, and they certainly don’t want to rebalance and monitor their funds, even if it’s just once a year.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you fall into this group, there is an option&mdash;for pension funds&mdash;at the very top of the investment pyramid. It’s an investment
         option that’s drop-dead easy: lifestyle funds.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Lifestyle Funds: Pension Investing the Easy Way</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re just arriving here direct from <a href="#calibre_link-52">page 165</a>, or you’ve read through the basics of investing and decided you want
         to take the easy way after all, no problem&mdash;the lifestyle option may be the easiest investment choice you’ll ever need to make.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In America, we have something similar called lifecycle funds and they are my favorite investment of all because they embody
         the 85% solution: not exactly perfect, but easy enough for anyone to get started&mdash;and they work just fine.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Lifecycle funds are simple funds that automatically diversify your investments for you based on age. Instead of having to
         rebalance stocks and bonds, lifecycle funds do it for you. If more Americans owned lifecycle funds, for example, far fewer
         retirees would have seen precipitous drops in their retirement accounts, because the lifecycle funds would have automatically
         changed to a more conservative asset allocation as they approached their golden years. Lifecycle funds are actually “funds-of-funds,”
         or collections made up of other funds, which offer automatic diversification. For example, a lifecycle fund might include
         large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and international funds. (And those funds, in turn, will hold stocks from each of those areas.)
         In other words, your lifecycle fund will own many funds, which all own stocks and bonds. It sounds complicated, but believe
         it or not, this actually makes things simple for you, because you’ll have to own only <em class="calibre2">one</em> fund, and all the rest will be taken care of for you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Lifecycle funds are different from tracker funds, which are also low cost but require you to own multiple funds if you want
         a comprehensive asset allocation. Multiple funds mean you have to rebalance your funds regularly, usually every year, which
         is a laborious process of redistributing your money to different investments so you get back to your target asset allocation.
         What a pain.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In the UK, there are only a handful of providers to offer lifecycle funds as a retirement option (Fidelity International is
         one). But many pension funds (whether it’s occupational defined contribution schemes, group personal pensions or stakeholder
         plans that you take out yourself) have at least one lifestyle fund (sometimes called a ‘lifestyle option’). These aren’t as
         sophisticated as lifecycle funds in the States in that they usually tend to move your investments away from equities in the
         last five or ten years of the term of the plan. So, if you set your retirement date to age 60 and choose a lifestyle fund
         that is active ten years before the end of the term, your money will be moved away from shares and into less risky investments
         from when you reach 50.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The criticism of lifestyle funds is that they are a ‘one size fits all’ approach. They will move money away from shares, no
         matter what the stock market is doing (and if they sell shares after a major fall in share prices, you’ll lose money). But
         they’re definitely better than keeping the same asset allocation (the same percentages in shares, bonds, cash etc) right up
         until you retire.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">What About Other Kinds of Investments?</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here are many different investments besides stocks, bonds, and tracker and lifecycle funds. You can buy precious metals, real
         estate, or even art; just don’t expect very good returns. And despite all my dire warnings, you can also buy a couple of stocks
         you really like.
      </p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">REAL ESTATE</small>.</strong> For most Americans, their home is their biggest “investment”, and yet, as investments go, real estate is not a very good
         one for individual investors. Why? Because the returns are generally poor, especially when you factor in costs like maintenance
       and property taxes&mdash;which renters don’t pay for, but homeowners do. I’ll cover real estate more in <a href="#calibre_link-37">Chapter 9</a>, but in general,
         most people confuse their house with an investment that they buy and sell for profit. Think about it. Who sells their house
         for profit and keeps the money? If your parents ever sold their house, did they move into a smaller house and enjoy the rest
         of that money? No! They rolled it over to the down payment for their next, more expensive house.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">You want to keep each part of your portfolio balanced so no one area overshadows the rest. If you’re spending £2,000 per month
         on your mortgage and don’t have enough left over to diversify into other areas, that’s not a balanced portfolio. If you do
         buy real estate, regardless of whether it’s to live in or to invest in, be sure to keep funding the rest of your investment
         areas&mdash;whether that’s a lifestyle fund or your own portfolio of tracker funds.
      </p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">ART</small>.</strong> A 1998 study at New York University produced some surprising results about art as investment. It showed that art is reliable,
         profitable (fine art returned 10.4 percent), and an effective hedge against portfolio volatility. However, by choosing particular
         art pieces as investment, you’re doing essentially the same thing as trying to predict winning stocks, and after reading <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a> you know how difficult that is to do. In aggregate, art investments may be quite profitable, but the trick is choosing which
         individual pieces will appreciate&mdash;and as you can imagine, that isn’t easy.
      </p>
      <p class="spb1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">HIGH-RISK, HIGH-POTENTIAL-FOR-REWARD INVESTMENTS</small>.</strong> Life isn’t just about lifestyle funds and tracker funds. Lots of people understand that, logically, they should create a
         well-diversified portfolio of low-cost funds. But they also want to have <em class="calibre2">fun</em> investing. If you feel this way, sure, use a small part of your portfolio for “high risk” investing&mdash;but treat it as fun money,
         not as money you need. I set aside about 10 percent of my portfolio for fun money, which includes particular stocks I like,
         know, and use (companies like 
         <a href="http://www.Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> that focus on customer service, which I believe drives shareholder value); sector funds that let me focus on particular industries
         (I own a tracker fund that focuses on health care); and even angel investing, which is personal venture-capital investing
         for private ultra-early-stage companies. (I occasionally see these angel opportunities because I work in Silicon Valley and
         have friends who start companies and look for early friends-and-family money.) All these are very-high-risk investments and
         they’re funded by just-for-fun money that I can afford to lose. Still, there is the potential for great returns. If you have
         the rest of your portfolio set up and still have money left over, be smart about it, but invest a little in whatever you want.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre6">If you don’t make an active decision about where to invest your pension contributions when you’re investing in your employer’s
         defined contribution scheme, your money will end up in the default fund (and, guess what &ndash; over 90% of people who sign up
         to a pension scheme end up in the default fund). Default funds often have a lifestyle option, but they don’t all take the
         same approach. Some may not start moving money until five years before retirement.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It’s definitely worth finding out a little about how the lifestyle option works on the fund you’re thinking of investing in
         and also (importantly) what it’s investing your money in to start off with. Some pension providers have half a dozen or more
         different lifestyle fund options, based on how much of a risk-taker you are when you invest, but &ndash; depending on the type of
         pension scheme you’re saving for your retirement with &ndash; you may not be offered such a wide choice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">To get an idea of how lifestyling and lifecycling compare, let’s check out two different funds. In the table below, you can
         see how the allocations in both funds change based on your age.

<p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="calibre6">Lifestyle funds don’t generally change the asset allocation while you are in your twenties, thirties or forties, and some
         experts argue that you’d get a much better result if you timed the move from shares to bonds yourself. But bearing in mind
         how inactive most investors are, this is definitely better than doing nothing at all.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Non-retirement investments: Choosing and Buying Your Investments</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ifestyle and lifecycle funds are generally only available to you as an option if you are taking out a pension (whether it’s
         an employer-based defined contribution scheme or a personal or stakeholder plan). That means if you want to put your money
         into something like a stock and shares ISA, you may not be able to use a lifecycle or lifestyle fund. Another option is to
         invest in multi-asset funds. These split your money between bonds, shares and cash-based investments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The advantage of using a multi-asset fund is that you don’t have to worry about having too much money in shares&mdash;the asset
         allocation is done for you. The disadvantage is that the way your money is split doesn’t usually change according to your
         age. The fund manager should make changes in relation to what’s happening in the economy, but it’s definitely not a completely
         hands-off approach.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The Investment Most People Have: A Pension</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s I mentioned earlier, not everyone who has a pension gets to choose where their money is invested. If your employer offers
         a final salary (otherwise known as a defined benefit) pension scheme, the money you pay in is just mixed together with everyone
         else’s. You can’t insist that it’s invested in a particular way. That means there’s one less decision for you to make about
         your investments. It’s down to those running the pension to make sure they get it right.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Money Purchase or ‘Defined Contribution’ Pensions</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f your workplace offers you a defined contribution pension, you will have already opened your plan and paid money into it.
         At the time, you’ll have had to choose a fund to put your money in (I suggested a cash-based or money market fund). Your human
         resources manager will tell you how you can switch your money into a different fund if the information isn’t on your employer’s
         website.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You know how I love reducing choice to get people to take action? Well, the companies that offer defined contribution pensions
         take this to an extreme: They offer a few investment funds for you to choose from&mdash;usually the options are called something
         like <em class="calibre2">aggressive fund</em> (which will be a fund of mostly shares), <em class="calibre2">balanced fund</em> (this fund will contain shares and bonds), and <em class="calibre2">cautious fund</em> (a more conservative mix of mostly bonds).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’re not sure what the different choices mean, ask your HR representative for a sheet describing the differences in funds.
         Note: Stay away from “money market funds,” which is just another way of saying your money is sitting, uninvested, in cash.
         You want to get your money working for you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As a young person, I encourage you to pick the most aggressive fund they offer that you’re comfortable with. As you know,
         the more aggressive you are when younger, the more money you’ll likely have later. This is especially important for a pension,
         which is an ultra-long-term investment account.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Depending on what pension provider your employer uses, the charges on these funds may be a little pricey, but on balance,
         you’re getting huge tax advantages and employer-match benefits. So, it’s worth it to invest in these funds, even if they aren’t
         perfect.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Group Personal Pensions or Employer-Based Stakeholder Schemes</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you’re paying into a pension at work where you get a choice of different funds to invest your money into, you may assume
         it’s a defined contribution pension, but it might not be. Employers can also set up personal or stakeholder pension schemes
         for their workers. If you don’t already know what type of pension you’re paying into, find out now. The information should
         be on the paperwork that you were given when you joined the scheme.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Group personal pensions offer a far bigger choice of funds than work-based stakeholder plans. Stakeholders typically might
         have up to 25 different funds for you to choose from, whereas a group personal pension (GPP) might have up to two hundred.
         Don’t get overwhelmed by the choice that’s on offer. You don’t need to worry about the ones you don’t put your money into;
         just pick funds that you’re happy with.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If there are no multi-asset funds on offer, you can set up your own mix of funds that will give you the right mixture of shares,
         cash and bonds for your own risk profile. If you took out your pension with the help of an independent financial adviser,
         you should have received detailed advice about the type of investment mix that would be suitable for you, giving you the best
         return while not taking on more risk than you feel comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">The Rule of 72</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Rule of 72 is a fast trick you can do to figure out how long it will take to double your money. Here’s how it works: Divide
         the number 72 by the return rate you’re getting, and you’ll have the number of years you must invest in order to double your
         money. (For the math geeks among us, here’s the equation: 72 ÷ return rate = number of years.) For example, if you’re getting
         a 10 percent return rate from a tracker fund, it would take you approximately seven years (72 ÷ 10) to double your money.
         In other words, if you invested £5,000 today, let it sit there, and earned a 10 percent return, you’d have £10,000 in about
         seven years. And it doubles from there, too. Of course, you could have even more by adding a small amount every month using
         the power of compounding.
      </p></div>
      <h1 class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre4"></a>Investing directly into a personal or stakeholder pension</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n <a href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter 3</a> I talked about how personal and stakeholder pensions were something you could buy directly from a pensions company,
         or pay into through your workplace. If you’re self-employed or your employer doesn’t make contributions to the group personal
         pension or stakeholder scheme they offer, you may have your own personal or stakeholder pension plan.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The brochure or website should include a few lines about what each fund does. There should also be some information about
         your own risk profile (whether you’re a cautious, balanced or adventurous investor) and a suggestion of the funds that would
         suit you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Depending on the scheme and pension provider you’re with, you may have access to a range of tracker funds (including FTSE
         index trackers, European index trackers and trackers that invest in a mixture of companies that make up the FTSE index and
         those that make up overseas indexes). You should also be offered several funds with a lifestyle option. With a stakeholder
         pension, you can switch funds at any time without penalty. It means you don’t have to worry about ‘getting it wrong’.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Investing in a SIPP</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you’ve taken out a SIPP (a self invested personal pension), it’s probably because you want to have much more control over
         your money. That means you’re unlikely to want to pay your contributions into your SIPP every month and leave your money where
         it is. Potentially, you could have access to thousands of different investment options when you open one up. That’s because
         you can put your money into shares in individual companies as well as investment funds ranging from the ordinary to very specialist
         (and probably quite risky).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you go for this strategy, make sure you don’t switch round your investments just for the sake of doing something. Yes,
         having control of your pension money can be a good thing, but you should check out the costs of switching your investments
         to make sure you don’t end up eating away your return with the charges.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">So You Want to Do It on Your Own</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, you don’t have access to a lifecycle or suitable lifestyle fund and you want to pick your own index funds to construct
         your own pension portfolio. That means you’re going to have to accept the fact you’ll have more work on your hands. If you
         pick your own portfolio, you can’t just ignore your funds and hope they’ll produce the returns you’re counting on. (That’s
         why I’m such a fan of lifecycle funds back home!).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Remember, most people who try to manage their own portfolios fail at even matching the market. They fail because they sell
         at the first sign of trouble, or because they buy and sell too often, thereby diminishing their returns with taxes and trading
         fees. (Think of all the people who sold off their shares in late 2008, not really understanding that there were bargains to
         be had by simply continuing their consistent investing. It was fear&mdash;not strategy.) The result is tens of thousands of pounds
         lost over a lifetime. Plus, if you buy individual tracker funds, you’ll have to rebalance every year to make sure your asset
         allocation is still what you want it to be (more on this in a minute).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But if you want more control over your investments and you just <em class="calibre2">know</em> you’re disciplined enough to withstand market dips and to take the time to rebalance your asset allocation at least once
         a year, then choosing your own portfolio of tracker funds is the right choice for you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">All right, let’s do this. If you’ve read this far, I guess my warnings and harassment didn’t dissuade you from building your
         own portfolio. If I can’t scare you, I might as well help you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As we discussed earlier, the key to constructing a portfolio is not picking killer stocks! It’s figuring out a balanced asset
         allocation that will let you ride out storms and slowly grow, over time, to gargantuan proportions. To illustrate how to allocate
         and diversify your portfolio, we’re going to use David Swensen’s recommendation as a model. Swensen is pretty much the Warren
         G of money management. He runs Yale’s fabled endowment, and for more than twenty years he has generated an astonishing 16.3
         percent annualized return, whereas most managers can’t even beat 8 percent. That means he has doubled Yale’s money every 4.5
         years from 1985 to today. Best of all, Swensen is a genuinely good guy. He could be making hundreds of millions each year
         running his own fund on Wall Street, but he chooses to stay at Yale, making just over $1 million per year, because he loves
         academia. “When I see colleagues of mine leave universities to do essentially the same thing they were doing but to get paid
         more, I am disappointed because there is a sense of mission,” he’s said. I love this guy.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Anyway, Swensen suggests allocating your money in the following way:</p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">THE SWENSEN MODEL OF ASSET ALLOCATION</strong></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00011.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">30 percent&mdash;Domestic equities:</strong> UK equity funds, including small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">15 percent&mdash;Developed-world international equities:</strong> funds from developed foreign countries, including the United States, Germany, and France.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">5 percent&mdash;Emerging-market equities:</strong> funds from developing foreign countries such as China, India, and Brazil. These are riskier than developed-world equities,
         so don’t go off buying these to fill 95 percent of your portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">20 percent&mdash;Real estate funds:</strong> also known as REITs, short for real estate investment trust. REITs are funds that invest in residential and commercial property,
         both in the UK and overseas.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">15 percent&mdash;Government bonds:</strong> also known as gilts, these provide predictable income and balance risk in your portfolio. As an asset class, bonds generally
         return less than stocks.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">15 percent&mdash;Index-linked gilts:</strong> these bonds protect against inflation. Eventually you’ll want to own these, but they’d be the last ones I’d get after investing
         in all the better-returning options first.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">A significant amount of math went into Swensen’s allocation, but the most important takeaway is that no single choice represents
         an overwhelming part of the portfolio. As illustrated by the tech bubble of 2001 and the real estate crash of 2007, any sector
         can drop at any time. When it does, you don’t want it to drag your entire portfolio down with it. As we know, lower risk generally
         equals lower reward. But the coolest thing about asset allocation is that you can actually reduce your risk while maintaining
         an equivalent return.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Swensen’s theories are great, but how do we make them real and pick funds that match his suggestions? By picking a portfolio
         of low-cost funds, that’s how.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Choosing your own tracker funds means you’ll need to dig around and identify the best tracker funds for you. I always start
         researching at the most popular companies: Legal and General is probably one of the best known providers of tracker funds
         in the pensions market, but Barclays Global Investors (due to be renamed Blackrock Global Investors following a planned takeover)
         and HSBC are also key players. HSBC has reduced its charges on trackers and Vanguard, which is a very popular provider of
         tracker funds in America, has recently launched low cost trackers in the UK (although as I write this these funds are not
         available for investors to buy directly, but have to be purchased via a financial adviser). There are other providers of trackers,
         so you should be able to find something that suits you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The first thing you want to do when picking tracker funds is to minimize fees. Look for the management fees (“expense ratios”)
         to be low, around 0.2 percent, and you’ll be fine. Really, anything lower than 0.75 percent is okay. Most of the tracker funds
         at Vanguard, Fidelity, and HSBC have relatively low costs. Remember: Expense ratios are one of the few things you can control,
         and higher fees cost you dearly&mdash;and they just put money in Wall Street’s pocket. See the chart on <a href="#calibre_link-53">page 157</a> for a comparison
         of how these fees can affect you.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Keep It Manageable</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="q"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">How many funds should I invest in?</em></p>
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7">A:</strong> It’s a little complicated in the UK because it will depend on whether you’re offered more than one lifestyle fund as a pension
         option. I’d certainly advise you to go fewer, rather than more funds. But if you’re picking your own tracker funds, as a general
         guideline, you can create a great asset allocation using anywhere from three to seven funds. Remember, the goal isn’t to be
         exhaustive and to own every single aspect of the market. It’s to create an effective asset allocation and move on with your
         life. And if you’re looking for those funds, check <a href="#calibre_link-51">page 180</a>.
      </p></div>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Second, you want to make sure the fund fits into your asset allocation. After all, the reason you’re choosing your own tracker
         funds is to have more control over your investments. Use David Swensen’s model as a baseline and tweak as necessary if you
         want to exclude certain funds or prioritize which are important to you. For example, if you have limited money and you’re
         in your twenties, you’d probably want to buy the stock funds first so you could get their compounding power, whereas you could
         wait until you’re older and have more money to buy the bond funds to mitigate your risk. In other words, when you look for
         various funds, make sure you’re being strategic about your domestic equities, international equities, bonds, and all the rest.
         You cannot just pick random funds and expect to have a balanced asset allocation. I use the Instant X-Ray tool (<a href="http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/instantxray/default.aspx?lang=en-GB">www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/instantxray/default.aspx?lang=en-GB</a>), which lets me compare various funds’ asset allocations to see how well they cover domestic investments, foreign investments,
         bonds, and more. It’s a great tool to help drill into your asset allocation and make sure your funds are well diversified.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Pound-Cost Averaging: Investing Slowly Over Time</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I want to sound smart and intimidate people, I calmly look at them, chew on a muffin for a few seconds, and then abruptly
         throw it against a wall and scream, “DO YOU DOLLAR-COST AVERAGE???” People are often so impressed that they slowly inch away,
         then turn around and whisper to people around them. I can only surmise that they are discussing how clever and knowledgeable
         I am.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Anyway, <em class="calibre2">dollar-cost averaging</em> (that’s pound-cost averaging to you Brits) is a fancy phrase that refers to investing regular amounts over time, rather than
         investing all your money into a fund at once. This is the essence of Automatic Investing, which lets you consistently invest
         in a fund so you don’t have to guess when the market is up or down. For example, if you have £12,000 available to invest,
         you could invest £1,000 per month for a year.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">But if you have the cash, why would you invest at regular intervals instead of all at once? Imagine if you invest £10,000
         tomorrow and the stock drops 20 percent. At £8,000, it will need to increase 25 percent (not 20 percent) to get back to £10,000.
         By investing over time, you hedge against any drops in the price&mdash;and if your fund does drop, you’ll pick up shares at a discount
         price. In other words, by investing over a regular period of time, you don’t try to time the market. Instead, you use time
         to your advantage.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">This can all be automated, of course. In <a href="#calibre_link-5">Chapter 5</a>, we covered your automatic infrastructure. To set up Automatic Investing,
         configure your investment accounts to automatically transfer money in from your current account each month. See <a href="#calibre_link-25">page 131</a> for
         details.
      </p></div>
      <p class="calibre6">Third, note that you should absolutely look at how well the fund has returned over the last ten or fifteen years, but remember
         that, as they say, past performance is no guarantee of future results.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It’s much better to look at returns over the last ten or fifteen years than it is to pick a shorter time frame. What you’re
         aiming for is a fund that has been consistent. Remember, this isn’t simple. Creating your own portfolio takes significant
         research.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As an example of what you might end up with, here’s a sample from Legal &amp; General’s index tracking funds:</p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">Shares (“Equities”)</strong></h2>
      <p class="spb2">30 percent&mdash;L&amp;G UK Equity Index Fund</p>
      <p class="spb2">20 percent&mdash;L&amp;G World (Excluding UK) Equity Index Fund</p>
      <p class="spb2">20 percent&mdash;L&amp;G Ethical Global Equity Index Fund</p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">Fixed Interest Stocks (“Bonds”)</strong></h2>
      <p class="spb2">15 percent&mdash;L&amp;G AAA-AA-A Corporate Bond Over 15 Year Index Fund</p>
      <p class="spb2">5 percent&mdash;L&amp;G Over 15 Year Gilts Index Fund</p>
      <p class="spb2">5 percent&mdash;L&amp;G All Stocks Index-Linked Gilts Index Fund</p>
      <p class="ulb">5 percent&mdash;L&amp;G Overseas Bond Index Fund</p>
      <p class="p">These are just a few of the literally thousands of tracker funds that exist. You can be flexible with the funds. If you want
         to be more or less aggressive, you can change the allocation to match your risk tolerance. For example, if you look at those
         funds and say, “Man, I’ll never get around to owning seven funds,” then be realistic with yourself. Maybe you want to buy
         the stock funds but just one bond fund for now. Maybe you don’t need to think about index-linked gilts yet. Pick the number
         of funds that will let you get started, realizing that you can adjust it later on to get a balanced asset allocation.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Spend time identifying the funds that will help you build a full, balanced asset allocation over time. You don’t need to get
         all seven funds listed above&mdash;even one is better than nothing. But you should have a list of funds that you’ll eventually buy
         to round out your allocation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS</strong></h2>
      <p class="calibre6">There is an alternative to tracker funds that you might find in your pension or ISA and that’s exchange traded funds or ETFs.
         These have lower charges than many tracker funds and are traded throughout the day like shares. They also have the advantage
         of following the chosen index more closely than a number of tracker funds do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The problem is that these funds are only available to pension investors who buy a SIPP (self invested personal pension). If
         you’ve joined your employer’s defined contribution scheme or taken out a personal or stakeholder plan, you’ll only be offered
         a limited range of funds.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">FINAL CHECKS BEFORE YOU BUY A TRACKER FUND</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">You might think that the only difference between tracker funds is the index they mirror, but you’d be wrong. So here are a
         few points to think about before you make your tracker fund choice:
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">How closely does the fund track the chosen index?</em> If a fund tracks the index it is aligned to closely, it’s said to have a low ‘tracking error’. The lower the tracking error,
         the easier it will be for you to follow what’s happening to your investments (and therefore to your retirement fund).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Do you replicate the index or just invest in a selection of stocks that make up the index?</em> Say you buy a tracker fund that tracks the FTSE All-Share index; if it’s going to buy every stock that makes up the index,
         it would have to purchase shares in around 850 different companies, which is way higher than the number that most investment
         funds hold. So, to cut costs, some funds buy investments that are designed to reproduce the performance of the index. This
         means you don’t get the same guarantees that the fund will mirror the particular index it’s aligned to.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Note:</em> Once you own all the funds you need, you can split the money across funds according to your asset allocation&mdash;but <em class="calibre2">don’t</em> just split it evenly. Remember, your asset allocation determines how much money you invest in different areas. For example,
         if you have £250 per month and you buy seven tracker funds, the average person who knows nothing (i.e., most people) would
         split the money seven ways and send £35 to each. That’s wrong. Depending on your asset allocation, you’d send more or less
         money to various funds, using this calculation: (Your monthly total amount of investing money) × (Percentage of asset allocation
         for a particular investment) = Amount you’ll invest there. For example, if you’re investing £1,000 per month and your Swensen
         allocation recommends 30 percent for domestic equities, you’d calculate (£1,000) × (0.3) = £300 toward your domestic-equity
         fund. Repeat for all other funds in your portfolio.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, if you opt for investing in your own tracker funds, you’ll have to rebalance about once a year, which will keep your
         funds in line with your target asset allocation. I’ll cover that in the next chapter.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span><em class="calibre2">s I write this, the U.S. is in the midst of a financial crisis. The stock market has dropped more than 22 percent in the past</em> two weeks<em class="calibre2">. It’s down 36 percent for the year. People are panicked. They’re pulling money out of mutual funds at record rates&mdash;$46 billion
            last week alone.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">I’m not one of them.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">In fact, I just made the largest investment of my life, moving $46,000 in my Roth IRA [pension] from cash into a Fidelity
            index fund. Am I scared? You bet. $46,000 is a hell of a lot of money. But I’m taking my cues from Warren Buffett, the world’s
            richest man, who in 2004 gave this advice: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Or, to put it in more familiar terms, “Buy low, sell high.”</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">I think the market is low right now, so I’ve made a lump-sum investment. But buying low can be intimidating. Suppose the markets
            never go back up? Nobody wants to wrestle with a bear. I’m taking a risk by attacking the beast head on.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Moves like this don’t bother me as much as they might bother other people (my wife, for example) because my risk tolerance
            is high. I have twenty or thirty years to go before retirement. That’s two or three</em> decades<em class="calibre2"> to recover from any further market drops.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Risk and reward go hand in hand. The historically high returns of the stock market are impossible without risk; anyone who
            tells you otherwise is lying. But not everyone can stomach having all of their investments in stocks and mutual funds.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">If your risk tolerance is low (if you’re scared of bears), or you’re approaching retirement, it’s best to keep your money
            someplace safe, such as bond funds or high-yield savings accounts. I keep cash equal to a few months of expenses in savings.
            I have a friend who is far less risk-tolerant than I am who keeps</em> an entire year<em class="calibre2"> of expenses in savings. (Please, if you’re going to set this much money aside, put it into a high-yield savings account or
            certificates of deposit!)</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Even if your risk tolerance isn’t all that high, you can still invest in the stock market, even during downturns. Dollar-cost
            averaging is an excellent way to do this. Dollar-cost averaging simply means making regular, scheduled investments instead
            of buying into the stock market all at once. It’s a way to mitigate risk. An indexed mutual fund decreases risk because your
            money is diversified across many stocks. Dollar-cost averaging decreases risk even further because your money is diversified
            across time.</em></p>
      
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">When I was dollar-cost averaging, I set up a system through ShareBuilder (<a href="http://www.sharebuilder.com">sharebuilder.com</a>), an online brokerage that’s a subsidiary of ING Direct, though there are many other ways to do it. On the first of every
            month, ShareBuilder pulled $250 from my credit union and used the money to buy shares of index funds inside my [personal pension].
            The process was painless. I invested every month, whether the market was up or down. It let me ignore the news and enjoy life
            knowing my long-term plan was in motion.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Dollar-cost averaging makes investing easy: you set it and forget it.</em></p>

      <p class="cotx"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou may have noticed that this chapter is one of the shortest in the book. That’s because you’ve already put the 85 Percent
         Solution into place and dealt with the most important parts of your finances: your credit cards, bank accounts, spending,
         and investments. Most people are still struggling with paying their monthly bills. So congratulations. But&mdash;of course there’s
         a <em class="calibre2">but</em>&mdash;if you’re seriously nerdy and want to know more about enhancing your finances, this is the chapter for you. We’ll cover a
         few topics that will help you optimize your investments even further. Remember, though: This is extra credit, so don’t feel
         the need to follow the advice in this chapter unless you really want to.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Feed Your System</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the previous chapter, you chose your investments and set things up so they run automatically. The automatic system is great,
         but it’s fueled by only one thing: the money you feed it. That means that your system is only as strong as the amount you
         put in it. The earlier chapters in this book were about implementing the 85 Percent Solution&mdash; getting started was the hardest
         and most important step. It didn’t matter if you were contributing only £100 per month. But now it’s about the raw volume
         you put into your system&mdash;more in, more out. Do you really want to wait twenty-five years to have £100,000? If not, feed your
         system as much money as possible now. Every pound you invest today will be worth many more tomorrow.

         <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk">www.thisismoney.co.uk</a> and open up their investment calculator. Enter in your monthly investment contribution, assuming a 5 percent return&mdash;don’t
         forget to factor in taxes if you’re not using a pension or an ISA. You’ll likely see that your current contributions will
         grow more slowly than you thought. But by adding a small amount per month&mdash;even £100 or £200 more&mdash;the numbers will change dramatically.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a>, I outlined a Conscious Spending Plan that suggested general percentages of income to allocate for savings and
         investing. Your first goal was to aim for those percentages. Now it’s time to move beyond those amounts so you can save and
         invest as much as possible. I can hear you screaming, “Are you kidding? I can’t squeeze out another cent. I hate you, Ramit!”
         This is not about me wanting to deprive you. Actually, quite the opposite: Because compounding works so effectively, the more
         you save now, the more you’ll have later (by a huge amount). You saw this in the 
         <a href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk">thisismoney.co.uk</a> calculator. Now, go in and play around with your Conscious Spending Plan to see how you can eke out a little more to put
         toward your investments every month. Optimizing your plan might involve doing some serious bargaining when you make major
         purchases like a car or house (see <a href="#calibre_link-37">Chapter 9</a>). Or you might need to cut your expenses as ruthlessly as possible. (Don’t forget
         to check out my “Save $1000 in 30 Days Challenge” at 
         <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/30daychallenge">www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/30daychallenge</a>.) You may even think about negotiating a higher salary or getting a higher-paying job (see <a href="#calibre_link-15">page 234</a>). No matter how you go
         about it, be sure that you’re shoveling the maximum amount possible into your system every month. Remember, it’s never easier
         to do this than when you’re in your twenties and thirties&mdash; and the more you feed into your system now, the sooner you’ll be
         rich.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Ignore the Noise</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow that you’ve mastered the basics of personal finance and set up your automated system, you’re going to start noticing how
         badly most other people are managing their money. Here, for example, are three real recent quotes from my highly educated
         friends:
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">“I don’t know what to do with my personal pension. I was advised to put it all in a cash-based fund for now since equity funds
            are not doing well. Is this right? How do you know when the downturn has hit bottom? Somebody said that it may take five years
            to get this mortgage mess turned around!”</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY RESPONSE</small>:</strong> The day-to-day movements of the market shouldn’t concern you. If you have a long time horizon, you’re automatically investing
         each month. When the market is going up, your system will automatically buy fewer shares. When the market is going down, it
         will buy more shares. Over time, you’ll do far better than speculators who try to predict where the market will go.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">“Forget tracker funds. I made a 67 percent return with my Russian managed fund last year, and that’s after fees.”</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY RESPONSE</small>:</strong> It doesn’t matter what happened last year, it matters what happens in the next ten to twenty years. Plus, if a fund goes
         up, it can also go down. That’s why asset allocation is more important&mdash;and less risky&mdash;than a superstar fund.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7">Q:</strong> <em class="calibre2">“Dude, you’re wasting your money on renting in San Francisco. Why don’t you buy a house?”</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">MY RESPONSE</small>:</strong> Renting is actually an excellent decision in certain markets&mdash;and real estate is generally a poor financial investment, which
         I cover on <a href="#calibre_link-64">page 250</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Look, you’ve decided on Automatic Investing because it’s a simple, low-cost way of investing. You’ve seen the research indicating
         that it beats traditional fund managers. And yet, every time your friends ask you one of those questions or you see a report
         about the “plunging” stock market, you’ll be tempted to change your investing style. Buy that tech company’s stock! Sell oil,
         it’s no good! The sky is falling!!! This is especially true in tumultuous times, like during the global financial crisis of
         2008. One day the market dropped 700 points, the next week it soared 900 points. As a result, the pundits were out in full
         force, making all sorts of absurd claims. The volatility spooked people, and ordinary Americans started withdrawing from the
         market. For most people, fear guides their investment decisions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Ignore it all. As I discussed in <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>, the benefit of Automatic Investing is that you don’t have to focus on these heart-pounding
         stock reports from pundits and magazines every day! Unlike other people, who will clasp their hands and worry about money
         (because they never took a couple of hours to learn how it works), you get to focus on the things you love: hanging out with
         friends, visiting your family, traveling, or whatever you want to do. Ignore the noise. Force yourself to resist logging in
         to your investment account more than once a month&mdash;that’s it. If you’ve set up your asset allocation and are consistently funding
         it, stick to your guns. You’re investing for the long term, and when you look back, day-to-day changes (even the cataclysmic
         plunges of 2008) will seem like minor blips&mdash;which they are.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Rebalancing Your Investments</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you have a diversified portfolio, some of your investments, such as international stocks, may outperform others. To keep
         your asset allocation on track, you’ll want to rebalance once a year so your international stocks don’t become a larger part
         of your portfolio than you intended. Think of your investment portfolio like your backyard: If you want your zucchini to be
         only 15 percent of your backyard, and they grow like crazy and end up taking over 30 percent, you’ll want to rebalance by
         either cutting the zucchini back, or by getting a bigger yard so that the zucchini is back to covering only 15 percent. I
         know, I know&mdash;I should become an organic gardener. Ladies, it’s hard to deny that I am a Renaissance man.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Most funds can’t be left alone for too long, so you’ll need to rebalance every 12 to 18 months. But if you’ve chosen to manage
         your own asset allocation, you’ll need to rebalance every twelve to eighteen months. Otherwise, within a couple of years,
         your allocation will be completely skewed. For example, let’s say you create an asset allocation based on the Swensen model:
      </p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION</strong></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00036.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Now let’s assume that domestic equities gain 50 percent one year. (For easy calculations, let’s hold all other investments
         constant.) All of a sudden, domestic equities represent a larger part of your portfolio, and all the other numbers are out
         of whack.
      </p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">ALLOCATION AFTER DOMESTIC EQUITIES JUMP 50%</strong></p>
      <p class="img"><img src="images/00012.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" /></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Although it’s great that one of your investment areas is performing well, you want to keep your allocation in check so one
         sector isn’t disproportionately larger or smaller than the others. Rebalancing your portfolio will make sure your assets remain
         allocated properly and protect you from being vulnerable to one specific sector’s ups and downs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The best way to rebalance is to plow more money into the other areas until your asset allocation is back on track. How? Assuming
         your domestic equities now represent 45 percent of your asset allocation&mdash;but should actually be only 30 percent&mdash; stop sending
         money there temporarily and redistribute that 30 percent of your investment contribution evenly over the rest of your investment
         categories. You can do this by “pausing” your automatic investment to particular funds from within your investment account.
         Log onto your account or ring your pensions provider. Find out what’s happened to your asset allocation. If there’s one fund
         that’s pushed your asset allocation out of balance, find out&mdash;from your pension provider or your pension scheme&mdash;what the options
         are for pausing contributions to particular funds so you can bring your investments back into balance.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Check out the chart on the next page to see how it works. As you can see, in this case, after eight months you’re back on
         target, more or less, and can go back to your original allocations.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Note:</em> There’s another way to rebalance, but I don’t like doing it. You can rebalance by selling the outperforming equities and
         plowing the money into other areas to bring the allocation back under control. I hate selling because it involves trading
         fees, paperwork, and “thinking,” so I don’t recommend this.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Don’t forget to set a calendar reminder to resume your automatic payments. With two minutes of math, which you may consider
         torture (unless you’re Asian), you can know exactly when to resume your payments.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If, on the other hand, one of your funds has <em class="calibre2">lost</em> money, that will also knock your asset allocation out of whack. In this case, you can pause the other funds and add money
         to the loser until it returns to where it should be in your portfolio. To keep the math simple, I recommend the Portfolio
         Allocator at 
         <a href="http://www.morningstar.co.uk">www.morningstar.co.uk</a> to help guide your rebalancing.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Stop Worrying About Taxes (and the 85 Percent Solution for Handling Them)</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eople worry about taxes too much, and they make all kinds of bad decisions to avoid them. Listen to me: You pay taxes only
         if you make money. If you’re paying 30 percent in taxes on something, it means you made 70 percent elsewhere, so do not freak
         out about taxes. Plus, it’s your damned civic duty. Want to complain about taxes? Go take a ride on a road anywhere in Africa
         or Southeast Asia. After two hours of bouncing in the back of a rickshaw, the top of your skull will be permanently dented
         and you’ll look like a coal worker from the <em class="calibre2">Titanic.</em> So give me a break, pay your taxes, do your civic duty.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Okay, that was a weird tangent. I hate to say this, but aside from the very basics of saving on taxes (like taking advantage
         of tax-deferred accounts and not selling investments before holding them for a year), chances are you don’t make enough to
         worry about them. You certainly don’t need to make investment decisions&mdash;like buying tax-efficient investment bonds&mdash;to save
         on taxes. People in their twenties who do this have usually read something in some magazine and then they start scheming ways
         to avoid the tax man. Let’s be honest. Once you’ve paid the maximum into tax-efficient ISAs and pensions, you’ll need more
         help in this department. But for now, follow that old adage: “Don’t let the tax tail wag the investment dog.”
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre5">Rebalancing Your Portfolio</strong></h1>
      <p class="p">Because your domestic equities now represent 45 percent of your portfolio, rather than the targeted 30 percent, you have to
         take action. Pause your automatic contribution to domestic equities and reallocate that 30 percent by distributing it evenly
         to the other five asset classes (e.g., each would get an additional 6 percent). £1,000 monthly contributions will now be allocated
         as follows:

      <h3 class="h3a"><strong class="calibre7">by nickel of

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span><em class="calibre2">nvestment experts have argued for years that asset allocation is one of the most important factors in determining your success
            as an investor. In other words, picking the proper mix of investment types in the proper proportions is the key to maximizing
            your returns while minimizing your risk. While entire books have been written about how to determine a proper allocation,
            much less attention has been paid to the ins and outs of maintaining this balance, especially when you (and perhaps a spouse)
            are managing multiple investment accounts.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Consider the case of a married couple with a taxable investment account, two Roth IRAs, and two 401(k) accounts. Even with
            a relatively simple allocation of X percent in domestic stocks, Y percent in international stocks, and Z percent in bonds,
            maintaining the proper allocation can get complicated. If you’ve chosen a lifecycle fund, none of this is really relevant,
            since you can just choose the same fund in all of your accounts. But if you’re handling your own asset allocation, how do
            you keep managing multiple investments simple?</em></p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">THE ONE POT SOLUTION</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">The solution is simple: Treat all of your accounts as one big pot of money. Instead of trying to hit the proper X/Y/Z allocation
            in each account, shoot for maintaining that allocation</em> overall<em class="calibre2">. In order to make this work with the least effort possible, keep one account as your “variable” account and make the others
            static. The variable account will contain a mix of different funds, which you can rebalance based on your target asset allocation.
            The static accounts will each contain a single type of investment, whether it’s domestic equities, international equities,
            or bonds. For example, your Roth IRA could contain a few different funds (and would be the variable account), while your wife’s
            401(k)* could be a static account, which you’d only use to buy domestic equities.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">If you need to rebalance your overall portfolio, log in to your variable account and make changes. For example, if your international
            equities have grown faster than your other investments, and are now disproportionately higher than you want, log into your
            variable account and exchange some of your international holdings into domestic stocks and/or bonds. Alternatively, you can
            change your ongoing contributions to put the international funds on “pause” until things even out.</em></p>
      
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">So how should you decide which assets go where? I have several guiding principles: First and foremost, tax-</em>inefficient<em class="calibre2"> (i.e., income-generating) assets such as bonds should go into a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or 401(k). Conversely,
            taxable accounts should only hold tax-</em>efficient<em class="calibre2"> investments like equity index funds, and you should try to make these accounts static to minimize the tax consequences associated
            with selling your investments when rebalancing. Finally, since withdrawals from Roth accounts such as a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)
            will be completely tax free, you should seek to maximize growth in those accounts by picking aggressive investments.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">The real benefit here is that keeping one asset type per account eliminates the need to rebalance within each individual account.
            Instead, rebalancing becomes a matter of tweaking the holdings within your variable account to bring your overall allocation
            back into line.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">You’ll handle ongoing contributions in much the same way. All contributions made into a static account go directly into its
            chosen asset class. For instance, all contributions into a 100 percent bond account would go to purchase bonds&mdash;and so on.
            You can then balance out your contributions across your variable account(s) so that your total contributions are in proportion
            with the desired X/Y/Z mix.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">THE DOWNSIDE</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">The only real drawback to this strategy is that, in an extremely turbulent market, your allocation might get so far out of
            line that you can’t correct it by rebalancing your overall holdings across accounts. For example, in the latter half of 2008,
            stocks dropped dramatically. So if you wanted to rebalance by selling bonds and buying more stocks, you might not have had
            enough bonds available to exchange into stocks in your variable account(s). In such cases, you’d have to “unlock” one of your
            static accounts and use that to help rebalance your portfolio. For the most part, however, you won’t have to do this, and
            this strategy will save you a ton of headaches.</em></p>

      <h2 class="calibre12"><a id="calibre_link-65"></a><strong class="calibre7">THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TAXES AND INVESTMENTS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Invest as much as possible into tax-deferred accounts like your pension and ISA. Because retirement accounts are tax advantaged,
         you’ll enjoy significant rewards. Your pension money won’t be taxed until you withdraw it many years down the line, and your
         ISA earnings won’t be taxed at all. More important, you won’t have to worry about the minutiae, including picking tax-efficient
         funds or knowing when to sell to beat end-of-year distributions. By taking this one step of investing in tax-advantaged accounts,
         you’ll sidestep the vast majority of tax concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Investing in tax-advantaged accounts is the 85 Percent Solution for taxes. Sure, you could create complicated tax structures,
         start putting money away in off-shore accounts, and use the annual gift allowance to give thousands away to others in gifts&mdash;but
         who the hell needs to do that right now? Investing as much as possible in tax-deferred accounts is the answer to 85 percent
         of your tax questions.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT SELLING</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you have money invested in a pension, you don’t have to pay capital gains-tax if you sell some of your investments (such
         as a fund or individual company shares, if you have put money into a self-invested personal pension, for example). And you
         don’t pay capital gains or income tax on profits from money that’s invested in an ISA. But even if you have money in taxable
         accounts, you won’t necessarily have to pay tax if you plan carefully.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Every year you get a capital gains tax allowance&mdash;a level of profit that you’re allowed to generate on your investments before
         you pay tax. As I write this it’s worth £10,100 (in the tax year that runs from April 6th 2009 to April 5th 2010). That means
         you’re allowed to make £10,100 profit before you pay a penny in tax. But any profit you make above that is taxed.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You’re also allowed to offset profits you make against losses for capital gains tax purposes. It means that with a bit of
         careful organisation, you can plan how you withdraw money or sell investments so you don’t get stung with an unexpected tax
         bill. The trick is to make sure you don’t leave it until the last minute (i.e. a few days before the tax year ends), to think
         about what you want to do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Since you presumably made a good investment, why not hold it for the long term? In <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a>, we covered how people can’t
         time the market. In <a href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter 3</a>, I showed you how buy-and-hold investing produces dramatically higher returns than frequent
         trading. And once you’ve factored in taxes, the odds are stacked against you if you sell. This is yet another argument for
         not buying individual stocks, and instead using lifestyle, lifecycle or tracker funds to create a tax-efficient, simple portfolio.
         Remember, all of this assumes that you made a <em class="calibre2">good investment.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Bottom line: Invest in retirement accounts and hold your investments for the long term. Until your portfolio swells to roughly
         $100,000, that’s about all you need to know.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Knowing When to Sell Your Investments</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n your twenties and thirties, there are only three reasons to sell your investments: You need the money for an emergency,
         you made a terrible investment and it’s consistently underperforming the market, or you’ve achieved your specific goal for
         investing.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">YOU NEED THE MONEY FOR AN EMERGENCY</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">If you suddenly need money for an emergency, here’s your hierarchy of where to get it.</p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7">1.</strong> Use your savings account. You should have built up a large enough cushion of money to be able to use some of it if you really
         need it. Hopefully, that money will be in an account that you can access within a few days, but even if it isn’t (if it’s
         in a notice account, for example), you’ll only sacrifice the interest you would have earned in that period.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7">2.</strong> Sell any valuables that aren’t critical to you. Seriously&mdash;use eBay. I’ll be honest: You probably won’t get a lot of money
         from selling valuables (people have a tendency to overvalue their own property compared with what others will pay for it).
         But selling some of your own goods is an important psychological step&mdash;it will let you prove how serious you are both to yourself
         and to your family (which will help if you’re asking them for help).
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7">3.</strong> Ask your family if you can borrow the money from them. <em class="calibre2">Note:</em> This doesn’t work if your family is crazy.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7">4.</strong> Use your credit card or a loan if you have no other option. I said earlier in the book that I wasn’t a fan of going for 0
         percent deals on credit cards, but if you’re really desperate it might be worth trying to see if you can get your money interest-free.
         Only do this once&mdash;don’t think this is a habit you can repeat or you could damage your credit score.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">YOU MADE A TERRIBLE INVESTMENT THAT’S CONSISTENTLY UNDERPERFORMING</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This point is largely moot if you invested in a tracker fund or series of tracker funds, because they reflect the entire market’s
         performance. If it’s going down, that means the entire market is down. If you believe the market will recover, that means
         investments are on sale for cheaper prices than before, meaning not only should you <em class="calibre2">not</em> sell, but you should keep investing and pick up shares at a cheaper price.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But let’s talk about this conceptually to understand when to sell an investment for poor performance. If you pulled up a list
         of your investments and saw the chart at the top of the next page, what would you do?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">“Ramit,” you might say frantically. “This stock sucks! I need to sell it before I lose all my money!”</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Not so fast. You have to look at the context before you decide what to do. For instance, knowing that the example is a consumer-goods
         stock, how is the rest of the consumer-goods industry doing? (<em class="calibre2">Note:</em> You can research industries by going to DigitalLook (<a href="http://www.digitallook.com">www.digitallook.com</a>) and clicking on “investing” then “UK Shares,” and finally “sectors and indices.” You’ll have to register for sector research,
         but it’s free to do.)

      <p class="calibre6">By looking at the stock <em class="calibre2">and</em> the surrounding industry (see chart below), you see that the entire industry is in decline. It’s not your particular investment.
         They’re <em class="calibre2">all</em> doing poorly. Now, this raises questions about the industry, but it also gives you a context to explain your stock’s plunging
         returns. And just because they’re plunging, by the way, doesn’t mean that you should sell immediately. All industries experience
         declines at one time or another. In fact, looking at the chart below, I’d dig in more to see what was happening with the industry.
         Is it still viable? Are there competitors replacing it? (For example, if you own shares in a company that’s producing cassette-playing
         Walkmans, chances are that business is not coming back.) From looking at the above chart, it appears that the stock is performing
         in line with the rest of the industry. If you think the industry or investment is simply going through a cyclical downturn,
         then hang on to the investment and continue regular purchases of shares. If, however, you think the industry won’t recover,
         you may want to sell the investment.

      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-72"></a>If you were to decide to sell your investment, the process is easy, but varies slightly depending on whether you have a self-select
         ISA (which lets you invest in single-company shares) or a SIPP. If you’re selling outside of a tax-efficient account (such
         as an ISA or a pension), there are tax implications. Go back to <a href="#calibre_link-65">page 210</a> if you need to refresh your memory. I want to emphasize
         that I almost never have to sell investments because I rarely make specific stock investments. If you pick a lifecycle or
         lifestyle fund or build a portfolio of tracker funds instead, you rarely have to think about selling. My advice: Save your
         sanity and focus on more important things.

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">YOU ACHIEVED YOUR SPECIFIC GOAL</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Buy and hold is a great strategy for ultra-long-term investments, but lots of people invest in the medium to short term to
         make money for specific goals. For example, “I’m going to invest for a dream vacation to Thailand…. I don’t need to take the
         trip any time soon, so I’ll just put $100/month into my investing account.” Remember, if your goal is less than five years
         away, you should set up a savings goal in your savings account. But if you’ve invested money for a longer-term goal and you’ve
         achieved it, sell and don’t think twice. That’s a great investing success, and you should use the money for whatever your
         original goal was.

      <h1 class="calibre11">Giving Back: Elevating Your Goals Beyond the Day-to-Day</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ost people spend their entire lives handling the day-to-day issues of money and never get ahead. How am I going to pay off
         that loan? Oh man, why did I buy that £300 jacket? Damn, I thought I canceled that subscription.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you’ve followed the steps in this book, you’ve moved past these basic questions. Your accounts work together automatically.
         You know how much you can afford to spend going out and how much you want to save each month. If something goes wrong, your
         system lets you easily see if you need to cut costs, make more money, or adjust your lifestyle. It’s all there.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Financial Options for Super-Achievers: Make the Ten-Year Plan That Few Others Do</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>’m always surprised by the e-mails I get from people who have optimized every part of their investing strategy and are nonetheless
         <em class="calibre2">still</em> looking for more ways they can optimize their finances. It’s easy: Just ask people five to ten years older than you what
         they <em class="calibre2">wish</em> they had started earlier, then do that. You’ll get three answers right off the bat:
      </p>
      <p class="nl"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">1. CREATE AN EMERGENCY FUND</small>.</strong> An emergency fund is simply another savings goal that is a way to protect against job loss, disability, or simple bad luck.
         Most people in their twenties don’t need emergency funds because we can just borrow money from our other savings goals or,
         worst case, go home to Mom and Dad. But if you have a mortgage or you need to provide for your family, an emergency fund is
         a critical piece of being financially secure. To create one, just set up an extra savings goal and then funnel money to it
         in the same way you would your other goals. Eventually, your emergency fund should contain six months of spending money (which
         includes <em class="calibre2">everything:</em> your mortgage, other loans, food, transportation, taxes, gifts, and anything else you would conceivably spend on).
      </p>
      <p class="nl"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">2. INSURANCE</small>.</strong> As you get older and more crotchety, you’ll want more and more types of insurance to protect yourself from loss. This includes
         home-owner insurance (fire, flood, and earthquake) and life insurance. If you own a home, you need insurance, but young, single
         people don’t need life insurance. First of all, statistically, we hardly ever die, and the insurance payout is useful only
         for people who depend on your livelihood, like your spouse and kids. Beyond that, insurance is really out of the scope of
         this book, but if you’re truly interested, I encourage you talk to your parents and their friends, and search for “life insurance”
         online to research the various options. You probably don’t need to buy a bunch of insurance options right now, but you can
         certainly set up a savings goal so when you <em class="calibre2">do</em> need them, you’ll have money to use. One last thing: Insurance is almost never a good investment, despite what financial
         salespeople (or clueless parents) will tell you. So use it as protection from downside risk&mdash; like for fires or accidental
         death when you have a family&mdash;but don’t think of it as a growth investment.
      </p>
      <p class="nl9b"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">3. CHILDREN’S EDUCATION</small>.</strong> Whether or not you have children yet, your first goal should be to excel financially for yourself. I always get confused
         when I see people on TV who are in debt yet want to save for their children’s education. What the hell? Listen up, Momma:
         First, get out of debt and save for your own retirement. <em class="calibre2">Then</em> you can worry about your kids. That said, just as pensions are a great way of saving for retirement accounts, stocks and
         shares ISAs and child trust funds have tax advantages that make them great for saving for children’s education. If you’ve
         got kids (or know that one day you will) and some spare cash, pour it into an ISA.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">These are just a few of the things you’ll be forced to think about in the next ten years. The best way to prepare yourself
         is to talk to successful people who are somewhat older than you and have their act together. Their advice can be invaluable&mdash;and
         can give you an edge on planning for the next decade.
      </p></div>
      <p class="calibre6">That means it’s time to think about elevating your goals beyond the day-to-day. Whereas most people might be so consumed with
         the minutiae of money that they’ve never thought about getting rich (“I just want to pay off this debt.”), you can set larger
         goals of doing the things you love using money to support you.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m afraid this will sound sanctimonious to some of you, but I really don’t mean it to be. I believe that part of getting
         rich is giving back to the community that helped you flourish. There are lots of traditional ways to do this, like volunteering
         at a soup kitchen or becoming a child mentor. I wanted to try to contribute on a bigger scale (plus I find that my jokes are
         not so welcome at soup kitchens). So, in 2006, I created The Sethi Scholarship (<a href="http://www.scholarships.ramitsethi.com">scholarships.ramitsethi.com</a>), which awards money and mentoring to one entrepreneurial young person per year. (Fun fact: The first year I launched it,
         not one person applied.) When I told friends I had launched a scholarship, they looked at me in disbelief. “That’s ridiculous,”
         they said. “I could never have enough money to launch a scholarship.” They said this while wearing $150 jeans and eating a
         $40 dinner. How easy would it be for them to set a savings goal and sock away money to give to others? Look, my scholarship
         is for $1,000. You don’t need to be rich to give back. Even £100 helps. And it doesn’t have to be a scholarship, either. Sites
         like 
         <a href="http://www.Kiva.org">Kiva.org</a> let you give directly to poor third-world communities. Or you can donate to your high school, local library, environmental
         action groups, the Red Cross&mdash;whatever means the most to you. And if you’re short on cash, donate your time, which is often
         more valuable than money.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you think about it, philanthropy mirrors the very same <em class="calibre2">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> principles you read in this book: The simplest step can get you started. But, as with managing their money, people over-complicate
         things and create artificial barriers to prevent themselves from giving back. You don’t have to be rich to be a philanthropist,
         just as you don’t have to be rich to invest. The point is that now you’ve got a personal-finance system that few others have.
         This allows you to elevate your goals beyond making it through the daily grind. When you think back to last year, what was
         the one big thing you accomplished for others? What will it be this year?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If I could hope for one thing from this book, it would be that you become a master of conscious spending&mdash;and then apply those
         skills to help those around you. Maybe it will be by establishing a scholarship, or mentoring a needy kid, or even just helping
         your friends manage their money for free. Whatever it is, you’re now in the very top tier of investing knowledge. You’ve moved
         beyond managing your money for short-term goals and you’re thinking strategically about your money and how it can help you
         to be rich&mdash;and how to share that with others.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If this were a movie, it would be raining, violin music would be swelling in the background, and a young soldier would slowly
         raise his hand to salute an elderly general. With all this talk about giving back, it would be very emotional, and a single
         tear would be rolling down someone’s cheek.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But we’ve got one last chapter to read. From the thousands of e-mails and blog comments I’ve received over the years, I know
         there are a few common issues that come up regularly. Apparently, life isn’t all about dissecting the nuts and bolts of asset
         allocation and creating compound-growth charts. Who knew? In the next chapter, I’ll cover the specifics of money and relationships,
         buying a car and your first house, and managing the daily questions that come up in your financial life. Last chapter! Let’s

      <h1 class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre4"></a>Student Loans&mdash;Pay Them Down or Invest?</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tudent loans are a big kick in the face that the real world has arrived. CNN reports that the average college graduate has
         around $20,000 of student loans&mdash;plus, as the U.S. Public Interest Research Group recently indicated, more than $2,500 of credit
         card debt. It can seem hard to get ahead when you have the baggage of student loans weighing you down. The good news is that
         student loans were probably an excellent financial decision (unless you ended up being an artist or actor… In those cases,
         get a real job). University graduates far outearn those with only GCSEs or A levels. Still, if you have $20,000 of debt hanging
         over your shoulders, you’re going to want to know how to handle it. Although we already talked about getting out of student
         debt in <a href="#calibre_link-34">Chapter 1</a>, there’s one additional question I constantly get asked: “Should I invest or pay off my student loans?”
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">INVESTING VS. PAYING OFF STUDENT LOANS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">It can be difficult to hear the drumbeat of “invest early!” when you’re scrambling to pay £100 or £200 in student debts each
         month. But when it comes to putting money toward investing or your student loans, you really have three choices:
      </p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Pay the minimum monthly payment on your student loans and invest the rest.</em></p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Pay as much as possible toward your student loans and then, once they are paid off, start investing.</em></p>
      <p class="bl1b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Do a hybrid 50/50 approach, where you pay half toward your student loans (always paying at least the minimum) and send the
            other half into your investment accounts.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6">Technically, your decision comes down to interest rates. If we’re talking about your loan with the Student Loan Company (rather
         than a bank overdraft), you’d want to pursue option one: Pay your student loans off as slowly as possible because you can
         make an average of 8 percent by investing in low-cost funds. However, notice I said <em class="calibre2">technically.</em> That’s because money management isn’t always rational. Some people aren’t comfortable having any debt at all and want to
         get rid of it as quickly as possible. If having debt keeps you awake at night, follow option two and pay it off as soon as
         possible&mdash;but understand that you could be losing lots of growth potential just so you can be more comfortable.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I recommend you take a close look at option three, and here’s why: The interest rate on your graduate loans from a bank (once
         you’ve gone past the interest-free period) will be higher than what you’d earn from the stock market, but your Student Loans
         Company loan is likely to be lower, so frankly your decision will be a toss-up. All things being equal, the money you would
         stand to make by investing would be about the same amount that you’ll pay out in interest on your student loan, so basically
         it’s a wash. It won’t really matter whether you pay off your student loans or invest, because you’ll get roughly the same
         return. <em class="calibre2">Except for two things:</em> compound interest and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. When you invest in your twenties and early thirties, you get huge
         benefits from compound interest. If you wait until you’re older to invest, you’ll never be able to catch up on those earnings.
       Plus, if you’re investing in tax-advantaged accounts like pensions and ISAs (see <a href="#calibre_link-6">Chapter 3</a>), you’re getting gains from tax
         benefits. That’s why I would consider a hybrid split, paying off your debt with part of your money and investing with the
         rest. The exact split depends on your risk tolerance. Most people will simply choose a 50/50 split to keep things simple,
         but if you’re more aggressive, you’ll probably want to invest more.
      </p>
      <p class="dta">LOVE AND MONEY</p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7">MONEY HAS A HUGE EFFECT ON RELATIONSHIPS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT</strong> your day-to-day life: I bet you have a friend who never leaves enough of a tip at restaurants or never pays you back when
         you lend him money. Nothing is more annoying than someone who mistreats you with money&mdash;and those are just your <em class="calibre2">friends</em>! Imagine when you have a husband or wife, and you have to share bank accounts and responsibilities for rent and car payments
         and everything else. You better believe money will be an issue.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s why I want to spend some time talking about how to handle money in your different relationships&mdash;your relationship with
         your parents, your boyfriend or girlfriend, your future spouse. I thought about dealing with money and your children, too,
         but considering I am planning to buy my kids paper towels instead of shoes, I may not be the best person to talk about that.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Letting Your Parents Manage Your Money Is Dumb</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou wouldn’t believe how many questions I get from smart, educated people who think it’s fine to let their parents manage their
         money. When you think about it, it is not that surprising. Parents who offer to let their kids send cash to the family money
         manager have probably coddled their kids for their entire lives. Do you want to let your folks feed you with a bottle and
         change your diaper, too? Don’t be one of these jackasses.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It’s time to grow up. Even though parents have good intentions, offering to handle money management is one of the worst things
         they can do for their kids. At our age, we should be learning how to manage our money ourselves. No financial advisers, no
         B.S. And if we make mistakes, that’s okay&mdash;maybe we lose £100 or even £1,000 now and again, but we learn from those mistakes.
         By doing this we get confident enough to be increasingly aggressive with our investments. Plus, chances are good that after
         reading this book you know more than your parents do about managing money anyway.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">If you take the lazy route and send your money to your parents, a few things happen. First, you develop a hands-off mentality:
         “Well, I don’t have to worry about it.” GOD, IF I HEAR THIS ONE MORE TIME, I AM GOING TO JUMP UP AND BEAT SOMEONE WITH AN
         ONION. (That way it’s unclear why they’re crying.) But as I’ve said over and over, investing is largely hands off once you
         do the initial research. Buy and hold means buy something and… hold it! Not too hard once you’ve done your homework. Plus,
         if it’s your own money and you made the investment yourself, you’ll actually <em class="calibre2">want</em> to track its progress. Trust me, it’s kind of fun.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Second, if your parents invest your money, you don’t get the kind of transparent information you would if it were your own
         investment. Sure, you could probably get your parents’ password and log in every once in a while and check… but would you?
         Also, if their entire portfolio went up 30 percent, what does that mean for your money (which was probably invested at a different
         time than their money)? How much did you actually make? I hate math, so I would avoid having to calculate this at all costs.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Third, you want to give yourself bottom-line accountability for any gains or losses. No blaming your parents, their financial
         adviser (who is paying <em class="calibre2">his</em> bills using the fees he charges you), or your parents’ fancy full-service account for charging you fees. Your investments
         should be yours, and so should the wins or losses. It’s fine to rely on your parents for advice, and your friends and the
         Internet are always there to help with evaluating investments, too. But in the end, the decisions should be yours.
      </p>
    <p class="calibre6">Finally, now that you’ve read this book, you can probably beat your parents’ return. (Go to <a href="#calibre_link-41">Chapter 6</a> and revisit the myth
         of financial expertise to see why.) So please, if your parents suggest you just invest with them, tell them why you’d rather
         do it on your own.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">How to Help Parents Who Are in Severe Debt</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s you could probably tell from my rant on parents and money, I’m a big fan of being self-sufficient with your money&mdash;whether
         or not your parents offer to help you out.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But sometimes your parents are in financial trouble of their own. If your parents are in a lot of debt, it can be very tough
         on your relationship with them&mdash;especially if they reach out to you and ask for help. In this case, your biggest challenge
         is not going to be coming up with a technical personal-finance solution for their problem. Instead, it’s going to be persuading
         them to change decades of bad money-management habits. Work through this delicately but firmly. They’ll probably be coping
         with the crushing guilt of having to rely on their son or daughter to help them with their finances, but don’t let them get
         caught up in feeling bad. Instead, identify where their money is going, set up a plan using the hierarchy of investing (see
       <a href="#calibre_link-77">page 76</a>), and then help your parents make the tough decisions that will be necessary. My readers have used what I’ve taught
         them to persuade their parents to do anything from finally setting up a retirement account (when they were in their fifties)
         to selling their house and downsizing their entire lives.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Every situation is different, but here are some questions you can ask. (Remember: Tread gently. Nobody likes talking about
         money&mdash;especially if it means having to admit to their kids that they need help.)
      </p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">How do they feel about their money? Why?</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">How much do they make per month? How much do they spend?</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">What percentage of their income are they saving?</em></p>

      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">What’s their average monthly credit card balance? Why isn’t it zero? How could they get it there?</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Do they have any investments? If so, how did they choose them?</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Do they own actively managed fund(s)? How much are they paying in fees?</em></p>

      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">What about other investment vehicles like a stakeholder or personal pension or stocks and shares ISAs? Do they have one?</em></p>
      <p class="bl1b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Do they read 
            <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com">www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com</a>? NO? WHY NOT, POPS?!?! (Note: I highly recommend that you scream this really loudly at them.)</em></p>
      <p class="p">Your parents might not have answers to all these questions, but listen closely to what they <em class="calibre2">do</em> tell you. I’d encourage you to take the 85 Percent Solution approach and figure out one or two major actions they could take
         to improve their financial situation. Maybe it means setting up an automatic savings account, or focusing on paying off one
         credit card so they can feel a small sense of accomplishment. Think back to when you didn’t know anything about money and
         it was incredibly overwhelming. Now you can use what you’ve learned to help your parents make small changes that will have
         big results.

      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">R</span>emember how painful those “Define the Relationship” conversations were back in college? Now imagine you have to sit down and
         talk about money while wishing you could use the sweat from your forehead to drown yourself. Sure, you and your boyfriend
         or girlfriend might have had an occasional chat about money. But when you’re getting serious&mdash;whether you’re recently engaged
         or moving in together or just at a point where your decisions start to really affect each other&mdash;it’s important to spend some
         time talking about your money and your financial goals. Talking about money with your partner might sound painful, but I promise
         you it doesn’t have to be awkward. As corny as it sounds, it can actually bring you closer together&mdash;<em class="calibre2">if</em> you know what to ask and stay calm. And if your girlfriend/boyfriend isn’t a nut job with £300,000 in credit card debt.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">The specific tactics aren’t as important as your attitude going in. The key is to start by <em class="calibre2">asking their advice.</em> Yes, even if you don’t need it! Bring the topic up lightly. “Hey, I’ve been trying to learn about money lately… What do you
         think about investing versus saving?” If you don’t get an answer, try this: “Okay, hey, I have another question… What do you
         think about my spending? Is there anything you think I should change?” I guarantee you they’ll have an opinion on <em class="calibre2">that</em>&mdash;and although you’re sacrificing yourself, at least it’ll get the conversation started.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">After a few days, ask for their financial advice again: “What do you think&mdash;should I pay off my credit card or my student debt?”
         (Of course, you already know the answer from <a href="#calibre_link-36">page 220</a>.) Then, a few days later, tell them you’ve been doing some more research.
         “I picked up a book on personal finance and it had some really interesting stuff in it,” you can say. “What do you think about
         talking about our money together?” (It is optional to add something like, “The book is by an amazing, weird, gracious author
         named Ramit Sethi, and I visit his website every day.”)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When you sit down to talk, once again start by asking your partner’s opinions: “I know you use cash to pay for everything,
         but this guy says we should use credit cards to build our credit and track spending. What do you think?” The goal of this
         meeting should be to agree that money is important to both of you, and that you want to work together to help each other with
         finances. That’s it!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If things go well during your first conversation, ask if your boyfriend or girlfriend would be willing to sit down again to
         go over both of your finances together. Remember, it’s not about criticizing or noting things that are being done wrong&mdash;it’s
         about figuring out ways to help each other so you can grow together. Some phrases you can use:
      </p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">“You’re really good at [X] and I want you to help me with my finances.”</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">“We’re going to join our lives together, and I want money to be a part of that.”</em></p>
      <p class="bl1b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">“One plus one equals three,”</em> which explains why you two can combine money smarts to create synergies. <em class="calibre2">Note:</em> Only MBAs or consultants can use this line with a straight face.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE BIG MEETING</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This is the big day when you both lay bare all your finances and work through them together. But remember, it’s not really
         such a dramatic step, since you’ve been slowly working toward this for weeks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">It should take about four or five hours to prepare for this meeting. You’ll each want to bring the following:</p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">A list of your accounts and the amount in each</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">A list of debts and what the interest rates are</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Monthly expenses (see <a href="#calibre_link-78">page 104</a> for details)</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Your total income</em></p>
      <p class="bl1c"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">Any money that is owed to you</em></p>
      <p class="bl1b"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">A list of short-term and long-term financial goals</em></p>
      <p class="p">When you sit down, put the paper aside and start by talking about goals. From a financial perspective, what do you want? What
         kind of lifestyle do you expect? What about vacations in the next year? Does either of you need to support your parents?
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Then look at your monthly spending. This will be a sensitive conversation because nobody wants to be judged. But remember,
         keep an open mind. Show yours first. Ask, “What do you think I could be doing better?” And then it’s your partner’s turn.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Spend some time talking about your attitudes toward money. How do you treat money? Do you spend more than you make? Why? How
         did your parents talk about money? (One of my friends has horrible money-management skills, which is confusing because she’s
         so disciplined and smart. After years of knowing her, one day she told me that her dad had declared bankruptcy <em class="calibre2">twice,</em> which helped me understand the irrational way she approached money.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The most important goal of this conversation is to set up a plan to manage your money, including your credit cards, bank accounts,
         budget, and investment accounts. Essentially, you want to work through this book with your partner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Your immediate goal should be to set up a few short- and long-term savings goals, such as a year-end trip and/or something
         a little more major like buying a car or putting a down payment on a house. At this point, it’s probably better not to run
         through all the numbers for a really large purchase because it can get overwhelming. Just set up a savings goal or two and
         set up an automatic monthly transfer for each of you. Longer term, you and your girlfriend/boyfriend should work together
         to get on the same page with your money attitudes. When you set a goal together (“We’re going to save enough to put a £30,000
         down payment on a house”), you’ll both be able to commit to working toward it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">LIVING TOGETHER: WHAT TO DO IF ONE OF YOU MAKES MORE MONEY THAN THE OTHER</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">The first question to ask is “Do you realize you’re living in sin?” Just kidding, I don’t give a damn.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Once you and your girlfriend or boyfriend start sharing expenses, questions will invariably come up about how to handle money
         on a daily basis&mdash;especially if one of you has a higher income than the other. When it comes to splitting bills, there are
         a couple of options.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The first, and most intuitive, choice is to split all the bills 50/50. But that doesn’t work for everyone.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">As an alternative, how about this fresh idea from Suze Orman? She encourages dividing expenses based proportionately on income.
         For example, if your monthly rent is £1,000, here’s how you might split it up:
      </p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">DIVIDING EXPENSES BASED ON INCOME</strong></p>
      <table class="table1b">
         <tr class="calibre9">
            <td class="new2">&nbsp;</td>
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">You</strong></td>
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Your partner</strong></td>
         </tr>
         <tr class="calibre9">
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Monthly income</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£3,000</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£2,000</strong></td>
         </tr>
         <tr class="calibre9">
            <td class="new2"><strong class="calibre7">Rental payment</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£600<br class="calibre3" />(3,000 / 5,000 = 60%)</strong></td>
            <td class="new1"><strong class="calibre7">£400<br class="calibre3" />(2,000/5,000 = 40%)</strong></td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHAT TO DO IF YOUR PARTNER SPENDS MONEY IRRESPONSIBLY</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This is the most common complaint I hear from newlywed readers. “Ramit,” they write, “my husband spends way too much money
         on video games. How are we supposed to save money? When I tell him this, he tunes me out and the next day, he’s buying something
         else.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The solution to this is to <em class="calibre2">elevate the conversation beyond you and your partner.</em> If you keep trying to tell your partner not to spend money on something, he or she will resent it and ignore you. More than
         anything, people hate to be judged for their spending, so if you continue making it personal (“You can’t spend that much on
         shoes each month!”), you’ll get nowhere.
      </p>
    <p class="calibre6">Instead, keep it simple. Turn to <a href="#calibre_link-79">page 106</a> in <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a> and look at how much it costs to save for common purchases like vacations,
         Christmas gifts, or a new car. Then have a conversation about what your savings goals are and how much you need to save to
         reach them&mdash;and come to a savings plan that you both agree on.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-13"></a>If you do this, the next time you have an argument about spending, you can steer it away from you and your partner and instead
         make it about <em class="calibre2">the plan</em>. Nobody can get defensive when you’re pointing to a piece of paper (rather than pointing at the other person). Say, “Hey,
         cool iPhone. Are we still on track to hit our savings goal?” This is hard to argue with if you say it in an innocent voice.
         In fact, they definitely can’t get defensive, because they agreed to the plan! By focusing on the plan, not the person, you
         sidestep the perception of being judgmental and work on bringing spending in line with your goals. This is the way handling
         money is supposed to work.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">The £20,000 Question: Why We’re All Hypocrites About Our Wedding (and How to Save for Yours)</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">A</span> while back, I was out with some friends, including one who was planning her wedding. Because both my sisters had recently
         gotten married, I suggested she check out a nearby stationery store for her invitations. “It’s really expensive, like fourteen
         dollars per invitation,” I told her. “But at least you can get some ideas for design.” She looked at me and without a hint
         of arrogance said, “Oh, I’ll check it out. I actually talked to my family and we have an unlimited budget for the wedding.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That one sentence rendered me speechless. She wasn’t bragging. She was just saying it matter-of-factly: Her wedding could
         cost <em class="calibre2">anything</em> and that was totally fine. She comes from a very wealthy family, so this isn’t so unusual. What <em class="calibre2">is</em> unusual, however, is that so many people will scoff at the above story&mdash;and then proceed to spend ungodly amounts on their
         own wedding while steadfastly insisting how absurd “most” people are. I want to help plan for these large life events. But
         be prepared&mdash;you’re going to have to confront the hypocrisy that we all have when it comes to these purchases.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">OF COURSE <em class="calibre2">YOUR</em> WEDDING WILL BE SIMPLE</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">When my sister called me to tell me that she’d gotten engaged, I was out with my friends. I ordered champagne for everyone.
         When my other sister told me she was getting married a few months later, I told all my friends again. Then I found out they
         were each having both an East Coast wedding and a West Coast wedding&mdash;for a total of four Indian weddings in a few months!
         I ordered a round of cyanide and made mine a double.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">That’s what got me started thinking about weddings. The average UK wedding costs almost £20,000, which is not much less than
         the average annual salary of £24,000. Hold on: Just wait a second before you start rolling your eyes. It’s easy to say, “These
         people should just realize that a wedding is about having a special day, not about putting yourself in crippling debt.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">But guess what? When it’s your wedding, you’re going to want everything to be perfect. Yes, you. So will I. It’ll be your
         special day, so why <em class="calibre2">not</em> spend the money to get the extra-long-stemmed roses or the filet mignon? My point isn’t to judge people for having expensive
         weddings. Quite the opposite: The very same people who spend £20,000 on their weddings are the ones who, a few years earlier,
         said the same thing you’re saying right now: “I just want a simple wedding. It’s ridiculous to go into debt for just one day.”
         And yet, little by little, they spend more than they planned&mdash;more than they can afford&mdash;on their special day. Look, there’s
         nothing wrong with wanting your day to be perfect. Let’s just acknowledge it and figure out how to achieve our goals.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Knowing the astonishingly high costs of weddings, what can you do? I see three choices:</p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Cut costs and have a simpler wedding.</em></strong> Great idea, but frankly, most people are not disciplined enough to do this. I don’t say this pejoratively, but statistically:
         Most people will have a wedding that costs tens of thousands of pounds.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Do nothing and figure it out later.</em></strong> This is the most common tactic. I spoke to a recently married person who spent the previous eight months planning her wedding,
         which ended up becoming a very expensive day. Now, months later, she and her husband don’t know how to deal with the resulting
         debt. If you do this, you are a moron. But you are in good company, because almost everybody else does it, too.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">Budget and plan for the wedding.</em></strong> Ask ten people which of these choices they’ll make, and every single one of them will pick this one. Then ask them how much
         money they’re saving every month for their wedding (whether they’re engaged or not). I guarantee the sputtering and silence
         will be worth it. This is a great idea in theory but is almost never followed in practice.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you think about it, we actually have all the information we need. The average age at marriage is about thirty-two for men
         and thirty for women. We know that the average amount of a wedding is about £20,000. So, if you really are committed to not
         going into debt for your wedding, here’s the astonishing amount you should be saving (whether you’re engaged or not):

      <p class="calibre6">Most of us haven’t even conceived of saving this amount for our weddings. Instead, we say things like</p>
      <p class="bl1a"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre2">“Wow, that’s a lot. There’s no way I can save that. Maybe my parents will help….”</em></p>

      <p class="p">More commonly, though, we don’t think about this at all: one of the most major expenditures of our lifetimes, which will almost
         certainly arrive in the next few years, and we don’t even sit down for ten minutes to think about it. Something’s broken here.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">SURPRISING WEDDING MATH</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">This is pretty cool in a sickening, gut-wrenching kind of way. I set up a simulation to see which levers were the most powerful
         in reducing wedding costs. To be honest, I thought reducing the number of guests would produce the biggest result.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I was wrong.</p>
      <p class="calibre6">Interestingly, changing the number of guests doesn’t change the cost as much as you’d imagine. In the example on the next
         page, reducing the headcount by 50 percent reduces the cost only 25 percent.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Beyond the obvious&mdash;negotiating for better prices on the venue and food&mdash;the best suggestion I’ve heard about cutting wedding
         costs is to tackle the <em class="calibre2">fixed</em> costs. One of my friends, for example, actually flew in a photographer from the Philippines for his wedding. It sounds extravagant,
         but even with the flight, he saved $4,000. In another example, my sister had her invitations designed and printed in India
         for a fraction of what it would have cost in the United States.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a>, I encouraged you to pick the one or two biggest problem areas in your spending and address them. Your wedding
         is no different: You want to look at the biggest expenses with a fine-toothed comb. Pick the biggest two or three expenditures
         and relentlessly cut their costs. Your honeymoon is going to cost £5,000? See if you can get someone to give you frequent
         flier miles as a wedding gift, check for travel deals online, enlist your second cousin who’s a travel agent, or see if your
         credit card offers any perks you can use. Bridesmaids’ dresses cost £400? Cut it in half by going with a local dress store.
         Chances are, it’s better to optimize the three biggest cost areas by 30 percent than to get a 10 percent reduction in everything
         (and it’ll keep you sane).
      </p>
      <p class="tt"><strong class="calibre7">SAMPLE WEDDING COSTS</strong></p>
      <p class="p">The table below shows the average fixed costs for a wedding of 80 guests. Obviously the cost of your wedding is going to change
         if you want to invite everyone you’ve ever met, including all your Facebook and Twitter friends.

      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7">I’VE SAID IT BEFORE AND I’LL SAY IT AGAIN: FUNDAMENTALLY, THERE ARE</strong> two ways to get more money. You can earn more or you can spend less. Cutting costs is great, but I personally find increasing
         earnings to be a lot more fun. Because most of our income comes from work, it’s an excellent place to optimize and earn more.
         In fact, negotiating your salary at a new job is the fastest legal way to make money. Your starting salary is even more important
         than you think because it sets the bar for future raises and, in all likelihood, your starting salary at future jobs. A £1,000
         or £2,000 salary increase, in other words, can equal many times that over your career. Now let me show you how to get thousands
         by negotiating for a better salary.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">Negotiating Your Salary, I Will Teach You to Be Rich Style</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a>, I wrote about asking for a raise at your current job. But the single best time to negotiate salary is when you’re
         starting a <em class="calibre2">new</em> job. You have the most leverage then and&mdash;with some basic preparation&mdash;you can earn £3,000 or £6,000 in a simple ten-minute
         conversation, then retire to a nearby café for a light lunch. Delightful.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When I coach people on negotiation, I pretend to be the hiring manager and ask the toughest questions they might get. My friends
         don’t like this, possibly because I also repeatedly crack jokes about taking the “role play” further than I should, but I
         force them to do it and they later thank me. When we’re finished&mdash;four to five hours later&mdash;they’re exhausted and cranky. But
         the people I’ve coached end up negotiating, on average, $6,000 more in salary.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Negotiating is 90 percent about mind-set and 10 percent about tactics. Most people don’t believe they should negotiate. They’re
         afraid of being “rude” or of having the employer rescind their offer. That almost never happens, especially because the company
         may have already spent up to £5,000 recruiting you. If you negotiate, you explicitly communicate that you value yourself more
         highly than the average employee. Are you average? If not, why would you settle for an average salary?
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">The basics of negotiating are very simple:</p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">1. Remember that nobody cares about you.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Most new employees come to the table talking about how much <em class="calibre2">they</em> want to make. To be totally honest, as a hiring manager, I don’t really care what you want to make. I would like to sit in
         the back of a Bentley with two hot twins and be fed a Taco Bell Grill Stuft Burrito with extra jalapeños. So when you’re negotiating,
         remember this: When it comes to you, your manager cares about two things&mdash;how you’re going to make him look better, and how
         you’re going to help the company do well.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Always frame your negotiation requests in a way that shows how the <em class="calibre2">company</em> will benefit. Don’t focus on the amount you’ll cost the company. Instead, illustrate how much <em class="calibre2">value</em> you can provide to the company. If your work will help them drive an initiative that will make £1 million for the company,
         point that out. Tie your work to the company’s strategic goals&mdash;and show the boss how you’ll make him look good. Highlight
         how you’ll make your boss’s life easier by being the go-to person he can hand anything to. And remember that your company
         will make much more off your work than they pay you, so highlight the ways you’ll help your company hit its goals. Your key
         phrase here is “Let’s find a way to arrive at a fair number that works for both of us.”
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">2. Have another job offer&mdash;and use it.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">This is the single most effective thing you can do to increase your salary. When you have another job offer, your potential
         employers will have a newfound respect for your skills. It’s like seeing the hot girl in the bar who’s surrounded by guys.
         You want her more because everyone else does, too.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Interview with multiple companies at once. Be sure to let each company know when you get another job offer, but <em class="calibre2">don’t</em> reveal the amount of the exact offer&mdash;you’re under no obligation to. In the best case, the companies will get into a bidding
         war and you’ll profit while watching two multinational firms rumble over you. I can think of no better way to spend a casual
         weekday.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">3. Come prepared (99 percent of people don’t).</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Don’t just pick a salary out of thin air. First, visit 
         <a href="http://www.mysalary.co.uk">www.mysalary.co.uk</a> and 
         <a href="http://www.payscale.com">www.payscale.com</a> to get a median amount for the position. Then, if you can, talk to people currently at the company (if you know someone who
         has recently left, even better&mdash;they’ll be more willing to give you the real information) and ask what the salary range really
         is for the job. Finally&mdash;and this is important&mdash;bring a plan of how you’ll hit your goals to the negotiating session.
      </p>
      
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Most of the negotiation happens outside the room. Call your contacts. Figure out the salary amount you’d love, what you can
         realistically get, and what you’ll settle for. And don’t just ask for money. Literally bring a strategic plan of what you
         want to do in the position and hand it to your hiring manager. Do you realize how few people come to a negotiation with a
         plan for their role? This alone could win you $2,000 to $5,000. And, of course, it allows you to negotiate on the value you’re
         going to bring to the company, not just the amount they’ll pay you.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">4. Have a toolbox of negotiating tricks up your sleeve.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Just as in a job interview, you’ll want to have a list of things in your head that you can use to strengthen your negotiation.
         Think about your strong points and figure out ways you might be able to bring them to the hiring manager’s attention. For
         example, I often ask, “What qualities make someone do an extraordinary job in this position?” If they say, “The person should
         be very focused on metrics,” I say, “That’s great that you said that&mdash;we’re really on the same page. In fact, when I was at
         my last company, I launched a product that used an analytical package to…”
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Have a repertoire of your accomplishments and aptitudes at your fingertips that you can include in your responses to commonly
         asked questions. These should include the following:
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Stories about successes you’ve had at previous jobs that illustrate your key strengths</p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions to ask the negotiator if the conversation gets off track (“What do you like most about this job?” “Oh, really?
         That’s interesting, because when I was at my last job, I found…”)
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5. Negotiate for more than money.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Don’t forget to discuss whether or not the company offers a bonus, stock options, flexible commuting, or further education.
         You can also negotiate vacation and even job title. <em class="calibre2">Note:</em> Startups don’t look very fondly on people negotiating vacations, because it sets a bad tone. But they <em class="calibre2">love</em> negotiating stock options, because top performers always want more, as it aligns them with the company’s goals.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Your line is “Let’s talk about total comp,” which refers to your total compensation&mdash;not just salary, but everything. Treat
         them each as levers: If you pull one up, you can afford to let another fall. Use the levers strategically&mdash;for example, by
         conceding something you don’t really care about&mdash;so you can both come to a happy agreement.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">6. Be cooperative, not adversarial.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">If you’ve gotten to the point of negotiating a salary, the company wants you and you want them. Now you just need to figure
         out how to make it work. It’s not about you demanding more or them screwing you for less. Negotiation is about finding a cooperative
         solution to creating a fair package that will work for both of you. So check your attitude: You should be confident, not cocky,
         and eager to find a deal that benefits you both.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> The phrase to use here is “We’re pretty close… Now let’s see how we can make this work.”
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">7. Smile.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">I’m not joking. This is one of the most effective techniques in negotiation. It’s a disarming technique to break up the tension
         and demonstrates that you’re a real person. When I was interviewing for college scholarships, I kept getting passed over until
         I started smiling&mdash;and then I started winning a bunch of them.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Smile. Really, do it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">8. Practice negotiating with multiple friends.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">This sounds hokey, but it works better than you can imagine. If you practice <em class="calibre2">out loud,</em> you’ll be amazed at how fast you improve. Yet nobody ever does it because it feels “weird.” I guess it also feels “weird”
         to have an extra $10,000 in your pocket, jackass. For example, one of my friends thought it was too strange to practice negotiating,
         so when he faced a professional hiring manager, he didn’t have a prayer. Later, he came to me like a clinically depressed
         Eeyore, whining about how he didn’t negotiate. What could I say? This lack of practice can cost, on average, $5,000 to $10,000.
      </p>
      
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Call over your toughest, most grizzled friend and have him grill you. Don’t laugh during the role play&mdash;treat it like it’s
         a real negotiation. Better yet, videotape it&mdash;you’ll be surprised how much you learn from this. If it sounds ridiculous, think
         about the benefits of not only the additional money, but the respect you’ll get from your boss for a polished, professional
         negotiation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="calibre15"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">9. If it doesn’t work, save face.</em></strong></h3>
      <p class="p">Sometimes, the hiring manager simply won’t budge. In that case, you need to be prepared to either walk away or take the job
         with a salary that’s lower than you wanted. If you do take the job, always give yourself an option to renegotiate down the
         line&mdash;and get it in writing.
      </p>
      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">NEGOTIATING TACTIC</small>:</strong> Your line here is “I understand you can’t offer me what I’m looking for right now. But let’s assume I do an excellent job
         over the next six months. Assuming my performance is just extraordinary, I’d like to talk about renegotiating then. I think
         that’s fair, right?” (Get him to agree.) “Great. Let’s put that in writing and we’ll be good to go.”

      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><em class="calibre2">I recently helped my friend Rachel, twenty-five, negotiate a job offer, and at my request, she wrote up the process:</em></p>
      <p class="p1"><span class="dropcap"><strong class="calibre5">F</strong></span>irst the big picture: I got a 28 percent raise in base salary, which comes out to more than $1,000/hour based on how much
         time I spent getting the job. Plus stock options, which at least allow me the luxury of dreaming about being a gazillionaire.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">I’ve applied to, and been ignored for, many, many job openings&mdash;more than I care to share. Despite this, I decided to jump
         back into the job market a few months ago after doing marketing for a large hotel in San Francisco. I found a marketing manager
         position on a site called VentureLoop (Craigslist for startups) and through it I sent in a resume, which snagged a phone interview,
         which was followed by an in-person interview, which was followed by an offer letter.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">Sounds like a cakewalk, right? Actually, the VP of Marketing told me that I had the least experience of anyone she was interviewing&mdash;
         then she hired me anyway. I can’t pinpoint exactly why I was successful in getting this job in contrast to all of my past
         attempts, but I can think of a few things that probably made the difference. My strategies weren’t rocket science but they
         involved time and effort, two things that definitely make a difference separating you from the pack.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">1. I BROKE DOWN THEIR JOB POSTING</small></strong> line by line and wrote down my skills and projects I’d worked on that directly related to their description.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">2. I RESEARCHED THEIR WEBSITE EXTENSIVELY</small>,</strong> read articles about the company, and looked up the management teams’ backgrounds so that I could speak knowledgeably about
         the company and why I was a good fit.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">3. I PREPARED A SPIEL ABOUT MY SOMEWHAT ECLECTIC RESUME</small>,</strong> which can look unfocused if not set in the proper context.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">4. I CALLED AN EXPERT ON START-UPS</small>,</strong> finance, bargaining, and a half dozen other things to get some outside counsel. Ramit gave me some key advice, including,
         “Tell them you want to get your hands dirty,” and “Suggest three things you would do to improve/enhance their marketing efforts.”
         Yes, he does talk just like he writes on his blog.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">5. I ACTUALLY TOOK RAMIT’S ADVICE</small>,</strong> which is where a lot of my work came in. I dreamed up three proposals for generating greater interest at trade shows, better
         responses to direct marketing efforts, and increased name recognition in the general population.
      </p>
<p class="btx1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="btx1"><em class="calibre2">Wow! So the interview must have gone really well, right? Not quite… and Rachel’s description of what she did is a classic
            case of turning a missed opportunity into a chance to win.</em></p>
<p class="btx1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="btx1">I never actually found a good opportunity to mention my ideas (this despite a four-hour interview). I e-mailed the proposals
         to my potential boss instead. I then individually e-mailed every person I spoke to that day to thank them for their time.
         Might have been overkill, but then again, my e-mail flurry may have been the tipping point for my hiring.
      </p>
      <p class="btx1">My references later told me that the VP had been impressed with my energy and intelligence, and had decided she would rather
         train someone with potential than hire a more experienced, and perhaps less flexible, individual. Three weeks of research
         and planning paid off with an entirely new career&mdash;a pretty stellar return on the investment of my time.
      </p>

            else’s (so much so that she actually didn’t have to negotiate much). And when she didn’t get a chance to show off all of her

            work that really makes you rich.</em></p>
</div>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Five Things You Should</strong> Never <strong class="calibre5">Do in a Negotiation</strong></p>
<div class="btx">
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">1. DON’T TELL THEM YOUR CURRENT SALARY.</strong> Why do they need to know? I’ll tell you: So they can offer you just a little bit more than what you’re currently making.
         If you’re asked, say, “I’m sure we can find a number that’s fair for both of us.” If they press you, push back: “I’m not comfortable
         revealing my salary, so let’s move on. What else can I answer for you?” (<em class="calibre2">Note:</em> Typically first-line recruiters will ask for these. If they won’t budge, ask to speak to the hiring manager. No recruiter
         wants to be responsible for losing a great candidate, so this will usually get you through the gatekeeper. Also, some government
         jobs require you to reveal your salary. But if a place insists that you reveal your prior salary, it’s a pretty good sign
         that it’s not a great job.)
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">2. DON’T MAKE THE FIRST OFFER.</strong> That’s their job. If they ask you to suggest a number, smile and say, “Now come on, that’s your job. What’s a fair number
         that we can both work from?”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">3. IF YOU’VE GOT ANOTHER OFFER FROM A COMPANY THAT’S GENERALLY REGARDED TO BE MEDIOCRE, DON’T REVEAL THE COMPANY’S NAME.</strong> When asked for the name, just say something general but true, like, “It’s another tech company that focuses on online consumer
         applications.” If you say the name of the mediocre company, the negotiator is going to know that he’s got you. He’ll tear
         down the other company (which I would do, too), and it will all be true. He won’t focus on negotiating, he’ll just tell you
         how much better it will be at his company. So withhold this information.
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">4. DON’T ASK “YES” OR “NO” QUESTIONS.</strong> Instead of “You offered me fifty thousand pounds. Can you do fifty-five thousand?” say, “Fifty thousand pounds is a great
         number to work from. We’re in the same ballpark, but how can we get to fifty-five thousand?”
      </p>
      <p class="ext1"><strong class="calibre7">5. NEVER LIE.</strong> Don’t say you have another offer when you don’t. Don’t inflate your current salary. Don’t promise things you can’t deliver.
         You should always be truthful in negotiations.

      <h3 class="h3a"><strong class="calibre7">by Trent Hamm of 
            <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com">www.thesimpledollar.com</a></strong></h3>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">E</span><em class="calibre2">very year, many Americans receive a welcome addition to their paycheck: a cost-of-living raise. This raise is a small percentage
            (between 3 and 4 percent) of salary that is added to keep pace with the increase in inflation. Some of us get even luckier,
            and receive a performance-based raise or a promotion.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">I know the joys of receiving a raise&mdash;and I also know how tempting it can be to spend the extra money. When I received my first
            significant raise as a working adult, which amounted to roughly a 10 percent increase in my salary, I celebrated. I bought
            an iPod and a pile of video games, and then later I “invested” the rest of that raise in some vintage baseball cards.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">To a small degree, that kind of behavior is fine. It’s great to celebrate our successes in life&mdash;when our hard work pays off,
            it’s natural and healthy to do something fun to mark that occasion, whether it’s to buy something new or to go out on the
            town.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">CELEBRATE A LITTLE&mdash;AND THEN GET SMART</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">As with many things in life, however, true success is achieved by finding a healthy balance. So when you receive a raise,
            don’t feel bad about celebrating&mdash;but do it modestly. Go out for a dinner date with your partner, or buy a DVD you’ve been
            thinking about picking up. And that’s where the celebration should stop. A mere increase in your income is</em> not<em class="calibre2"> a call to change your standard of living.</em></p>
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">Instead, use your raise to put yourself in a better financial position. Start by calculating how much your take-home pay will
            increase each month after your raise and then plan on setting aside most of that extra money. The next step is to automatically
            transfer that amount from your checking account to your savings account each time you’re paid, so that you’re never tempted
            to check your account balance and spend more than you should.</em></p>
      
      <p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre2">What do you do with that saved amount? You have a lot of options. If you’re still carrying student loans or credit card debt,
            you can use it to accelerate your repayment plan, which will allow you to systematically eliminate your personal debt more
            quickly. Another smart move is to simply let it build up in your savings account as an emergency fund. This cash will come
            in handy if you need a major car repair or if you lose your job, for example. Another tactic is to invest it toward a long-term
            goal, like a home for yourself and your (potential) family or for retirement.</em></p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">BE LIKE WARREN BUFFETT</small>.</strong> <em class="calibre2">Storing away your extra income also has a second benefit: it keeps you from growing your standard of living in step with the
            growth in your paycheck. While it can be very tempting to do this, I encourage you to look at the story of Warren Buffett.
            His abilities as a businessman and investor have made him the richest man in America, yet he still lives in the same modest
            house in Omaha, Nebraska, that he’s lived in for much of his adult life. Buffett realized long ago that having money doesn’t
            require you to spend it and that the money you don’t spend can be invested, growing from a small amount today into a large
            amount tomorrow. His $50 billion net worth certainly attests to it.</em></p>

      <p class="line1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="p"><strong class="calibre7">WHEN IT COMES TO SAVING MONEY, BIG PURCHASES ARE YOUR CHANCE</strong> to shine&mdash;and to dominate your clueless friends who are so proud of not ordering Cokes when they eat out, yet waste thousands
         when they buy large items like furniture, a car, or a house. When you buy something major, you can save massive amounts of
         money&mdash;£2,000 on a car or £200,000 on a house&mdash;that will make your other attempts to save money pale in comparison. Big-ticket
         items like these, however, are where people most commonly make mistakes. They don’t comparison shop, they overpay because
         a salesperson cons them into spending too much, and worst of all they then think they got a good deal. Don’t be one of these
         people!
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11"><a id="calibre_link-20" class="calibre4"></a>A Fresh Look at Buying a Car</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s strange how many people make an effort to save on things like clothes and eating out, but when it comes to large purchases
         like cars, make poor decisions and erase any savings they’ve accumulated along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let me first tell you that the single most important decision associated with buying a car is not the brand or the mileage
         or the rims (please jump off a bridge if you buy specialty rims). Surprisingly, from a financial perspective, the most important
         factor is <em class="calibre2">how long you keep the car before selling it.</em> You could get the best deal in the world, but if you sell the car after four years, you’ve lost money. Instead, understand
         how much you can afford, pick a reliable car, maintain it well, and drive it for as long as humanly possible. Yes, that means
         you need to drive it for more than ten years, because it’s only once you finish the payments that the real savings start.
         And by taking good care of your car, you can save even more enormous piles of money over the long term&mdash;and you’ll have a great
         car.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">There are four steps to buying a car: Budgeting, Picking a Car, Negotiating Like an Indian, and Maintaining Your Car.</p>
    <p class="calibre6">First, ask yourself how buying a car fits into your spending and saving priorities (see <a href="#calibre_link-60">Chapter 4</a>). If you’re satisfied with
         a used Toyota Corolla and would rather put your extra money toward investing for growth, great. On the other hand, if you
         really love BMWs and can afford to buy one, then you should do it. This is conscious spending, applied.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Once you’ve thought about where your car fits into your priorities, you need to look at your Conscious Spending Plan and decide
         what you’re willing to allocate toward your car each month. This is the number you keep in your back pocket as the number
         you can afford <em class="calibre2">to spend up to.</em> Ideally you’ll spend less. (<em class="calibre2">Note:</em> Ignore the advertisements for “$199/ month.” Those are scammy introductory rates that are simply not real.)
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">So, knowing that there will be other expenses involved in the total expense of having a car, you want to decide how much you
         want to spend on the car itself. For example, if you can afford a total monthly payment of $500 toward your car, you can probably
         afford a car that costs $200 to $250 per month. (For example, my monthly car payment of $350.75 actually adds up to around
         $1,000 when I factor in insurance, gas, maintenance, and $200/ month San Francisco parking.) With a budget of around $200
         per month for your car itself, that means you can afford a car that costs around $12,000 over five years. Pretty sobering
         compared with what most people think they can afford, right? This shows you how easy it is to overspend on a car.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">IF YOU PICK A CRAPPY CAR, YOU ARE A MORON</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Please, pick a good car. There are some cars that are just objectively bad decisions that nobody should ever buy. For example,
         has anyone with an IQ over 42 ever consciously chosen to buy a Chevy Lumina? Sadly, many people I know are seduced by the
         shiny new cars at the dealership. But it’s important to remember that you’re not just buying the car for today&mdash;you’re buying
         it for the next ten-plus years. Buying a flashy car can be like dating a hot yet vapid girl: The hotness will wear off after
         a little while, and all you’ll be left with is the unsatisfying person beneath. That is why when I’m checking girls out, I
         always exclaim loudly to my friend, “HEY, MAN, REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO OPTIMIZE FOR THE LONG TERM.” Trust me, when girls overhear
         that, they can’t resist me.

      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">DO YOUR RESEARCH</strong> by looking at car brokers, internet companies and car supermarkets. Check out online sites of car magazines like <em class="calibre2">What Car</em> to get information about the car you’re thinking of buying.
      </p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">CALCULATE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP</strong> (TCO). This means you figure out how much you’ll be spending over the life of the car&mdash;these expenses can have a big effect
         on your finances. Besides the cost of the car and the interest on your loan, the TCO should include maintenance, gas, insurance,
         and resale value. By understanding even a rough ballpark of how much these “invisible” costs will run you, you’ll be able
         to save more accurately&mdash;and avoid surprises when you get a $600 car-repair fee.
      </p>
      <p class="bl3"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">BUY A CAR THAT WILL LAST YOU AT LEAST TEN YEARS,</strong> not one that looks cool. Looks fade and you’re still going to be stuck with the payments. Optimize for the long term.
      </p>
      <p class="boxh2"><span class="line5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">PERSONAL CONTRACT PURCHASE OR LEASE.</strong> These deals nearly always benefits the dealer, not you. They appeal to people who want the newest car and are willing to
         pay exorbitant amounts and get nothing to show for it&mdash;so, wealthy people who want new cars every two years, and in some cases,
         businesses for tax reasons. Not you! Buy a car and hold it for the long term. <em class="calibre2">Consumer Reports</em> research recently “determined that buying a car&mdash;in this case, the best-selling 2008 Honda Accord EX, at $24,495&mdash;would cost
         $4,597 less over five years than closed-end leasing for exactly the same model.” If that doesn’t persuade you not to lease,
         I don’t know what will.
      </p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">SELL YOUR CAR IN FEWER THAN SEVEN YEARS.</strong> The real savings come once you’ve paid off your car loan and driven it for as long as possible. Most people sell their cars
         far too early. It’s much cheaper to maintain your car well and drive it into the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="bl2"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">ASSUME YOU HAVE TO BUY A USED CAR.</strong> Run the numbers. Over the long term, a new car may end up saving you money, if you pick the right new car, pay the right
         price, and drive it for a long time. See below for my story on buying a new car.
      </p>
      <p class="bl3"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7">STRETCH YOUR BUDGET FOR A CAR.</strong> Set a realistic budget for your car and don’t go over it. Be honest with yourself. Other expenses will come up&mdash;maybe car
         related, maybe not&mdash;and you don’t want to end up struggling because you can’t afford your monthly car payment.
      </p>
</div>
      <p class="calibre6">First, any car you evaluate must fit within your budget. This will eliminate most cars automatically. Do not even look at
         cars you can’t afford.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Second, the car must be a <em class="calibre2">good car.</em> “But Ramit,” you might say, “who can say what a good car is? One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.” Listen, there is
         one person who will say what a good car is: me. Here’s what makes a good car:
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">RELIABILITY</small>.</strong> When I bought my car, above all, I wanted one that would not break down. I have enough stuff going on in my life, and I want
         to avoid car-repair issues that cost time and money as much as possible. Because this was a high priority, I was willing to
         pay slightly more for it.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">A CAR YOU LOVE</small>.</strong> I’ve written time and time again about consciously spending on the things you love. For me, since I’d be driving the car
         for a long time, I wanted to pick one that I really enjoyed driving. And like a dutiful Indian son, I love not having to worry
         about it breaking down.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">RESALE VALUE</small>.</strong> One of my friends bought a $20,000 Acura Integra, drove it for about seven years, and then sold it for 50 percent of the
         price. That means she got a fantastic deal on driving a new car for seven years. To check out how your potential cars will
         fare, visit 
         <a href="http://www.whatcar.com">www.whatcar.com</a>/car-depreciation-calculator/ and calculate resale prices in five, seven, and ten years. You’ll be surprised how quickly
         most cars depreciate and how others (Toyotas and Hondas especially) retain their value.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">INSURANCE</small>.</strong> The insurance rates for a new and used car can be pretty different. Even if they’re only slightly different (say, £25/month),
         that can add up over many years.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">FUEL EFFICIENCY</small>.</strong> With gas prices on a roller-coaster ride, you may want to hedge your bets and consider a very fuel-efficient, or even a hybrid,
         car. This could be an important factor in determining the value of a car over the long term.
      </p>
      <p class="bl"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">THE DOWN PAYMENT</small>.</strong> This is important. If you don’t have much cash to put down, a used car is more attractive because the down payment (i.e.,
         money you have to pay when you buy the car) is typically lower. And if you put £0 down, the interest charges on a new car
         will be much more. In my case, I had cash available to put down.
      </p>
      <p class="bl1"><img src="images/00020.jpeg" alt="art" class="calibre1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">INTEREST RATE</small>.</strong> The interest rate on your car loan will depend on your credit, which is why having a good credit score matters (see <a href="#calibre_link-80">page 16</a>). If you have multiple sources of good credit, your interest rate will be lower. This becomes more important over a longer-term
         loan. Each car dealership will negotiate differently. Don’t be afraid to walk out if the dealer tries to change the finance
         terms on you at the last minute. This is a common trick.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">CONQUERING CAR SALESPEOPLE BY OUTNEGOTIATING THEM</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I’ve seen more than my share of negotiations&mdash;including watching my dad negotiate with car dealers for multiple days. I think
         we actually ate breakfast at a dealership once.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">You must negotiate mercilessly with dealers. I have never seen as many people make bad purchasing decisions as when they’re
         in a car dealer’s office. If you’re not a hardball negotiator, take someone with you who is. If possible, buy a car at the
         end of the year, when dealers are salivating to beat their quotas and are far more willing to negotiate. Their saliva is your
         salvation!
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I recommend using Parker’s price guide to find out how much your car should be worth new and also what its target price should
         be (that is, how much of a discount you should be able to negotiate (What Car has a similar service on its website). I used
         
         <a href="http://www.fightingchance.com">www.fightingchance.com</a> in the United States, which told me exactly how much dealers were paying for my car&mdash;including details about little-known
         “dealer withholding.” For instance, I spent a month on the site researching and planning and then bought my car for $2,000
         <em class="calibre2">under invoice.</em> The service also provided specific tips for how to negotiate from the comfort of your sofa. You don’t even have to set foot
         in a dealership until the very end.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Here’s how I did it:</p>
      <p class="calibre6">When I decided to buy&mdash;at the end of December, when salespeople are desperate to meet their quotas&mdash;I faxed seventeen car dealers
         and told them exactly which car I wanted. I said I was prepared to buy the car within two weeks and, because I knew exactly
         how much profit they would make off the car, I would go with the lowest price offered to me. The same day, as I sat back with
         a cup of Earl Grey tea and a Taco Bell burrito, faxes started rolling in from the dealers. After I had all the offers, I called
         the dealers, told them the lowest price I’d received, and gave each of them a chance to beat it. This resulted in a bidding
         war that led to a downward spiral of near-orgasmic deals.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">In the end, I chose a dealer in Palo Alto who sold me the car for $2,000 under invoice&mdash;a nearly unheard-of price. I didn’t
         have to waste my time going to multiple dealerships, and I didn’t have to bother with slimy car salesmen. I went into only
         one dealer’s office: the winning one.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><a id="calibre_link-64"></a><strong class="calibre7">BORING BUT PROFITABLE: MAINTAINING YOUR CAR</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I know that keeping your car well maintained doesn’t sound sexy, but it will make you rich when you eventually sell your car.
         So take your car’s maintenance as seriously as your retirement savings: As soon as you buy your car, enter the major maintenance
         checkpoints into your calendar so you remember them. Here’s a hint: The average UK car is driven about ten thousand miles
         per year. You can use that number as a starting point to calculate a maintenance schedule based on the car manufacturer’s
         instructions.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Of course, you also need to have regular oil changes, watch your tire pressure, and keep your car clean. I keep a record of
         each service I have, along with any notes. When I sell my car, I’ll show the documentation to the buyer to prove how meticulous
         I’ve been (and charge the buyer accordingly). People often forget this and slap their foreheads when they go to sell their
         car, only to be negotiated down (by someone like me) for not keeping detailed maintenance records. Don’t let yourself get
         outmaneuvered by a lack of paperwork.

      <h1 class="calibre11">The Biggest Big-Ticket Item of All: Buying a House</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f I asked people, “Hey, would you like to make a hundred thousand pounds in one year?” who wouldn’t say yes? And if I sweetened
         the offer by saying you’d have to spend only ten hours per week that year to do it, I guarantee every single person I asked
         would go for it. So why don’t people spend that amount of time researching the biggest purchase of their lives? By doing the
         research that 99 percent of other people don’t, you can save tens of thousands of pounds on your house over the life of your
         loan. That’s why, when I hear about people who “fell in love” with a house and then “had to have it on the spot,” I am reminded
         why I wish I could pull a red wagon full of tomatoes everywhere I go.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Buying a house is the most complicated and significant purchase you’ll make, so it pays to understand everything about it
         beforehand. I mean <em class="calibre2">everything.</em> This isn’t a pair of pants at The Gap. When you buy a house worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, you should be an expert
         on the tricks and common mistakes most home buyers make. You should know all the common real estate terms, and how to push
         and pull to get the best deal. And you should understand that houses are primarily for living in, not for making huge cash
         gains.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Look, if you buy a house without opening up a spreadsheet and entering some numbers, you are a fool. Remember, if you can
         save £10,000 or £30,000 over the entire course of a twenty-five-year loan just by educating yourself a little, it’s certainly
         worth your time. I’m going to help you figure out if buying a house is right for you, and then I’m going to give you an overview
         of the things you’ll need to do over the next few months&mdash;at least three months, probably twelve&mdash;to prepare to buy. I can’t
         cover all the tips here, but I’ll get you started with the basics.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">WHO SHOULD BUY A HOUSE?</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">From our earliest days, we’re taught that the American dream is to own a house, have 2.5 kids, and retire into the sunset.
         In fact, I have friends who graduated from college and the first major purchase they wanted to make was a house. What the
         hell? No budget, no pension, but they wanted to buy a house? When I ask my younger friends why they want to buy a house, they
         stare at me blankly. “They’re a good investment,” they reply like brainless automatons who are at risk of being smacked by
         me.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Actually, houses really aren’t very good investments in general. But I’ll cover that in a minute. Back to who should buy:</p>
      <p class="calibre6">First and foremost, you should buy a house only if it makes financial sense. In the olden days, this meant that your house
         would cost no more than 2.5 times your annual income, you’d be able to put at least 20 percent of the purchase price down,
         and the total monthly payments (including the mortgage, maintenance, insurance, and taxes) would be about 30 percent of your
         gross income. If you make £50,000 per year before taxes, that means your house would cost £125,000, you’d put £25,000 down,
         and the total monthly payments would be £1,250 per month. Yeah, right. Maybe if you live in the sticks.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Things are a little different now, but that doesn’t explain the stupidity of people who purchase houses for ten times their
         salaries with zero money down. Sure, you can stretch those traditional guidelines a little, but if you buy something you simply
         can’t afford, it <em class="calibre2">will</em> come around and bite you in the ass.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Let me be crystal clear: Can you afford at least a 10 percent down payment for the house (25 percent will give you a better
         choice of mortgages)? If not, set a savings goal and don’t even think about buying until you reach it. Even if you’ve got
         a down payment, you still need to be sure you make enough money to cover the monthly payments. You might be tempted to think,
         “Oh, I’m paying £1,000/month for my apartment, so I can definitely afford £1,000 for a house!” Wrong. First off, chances are
         you’ll want to buy a nicer house than you’re currently renting, which means the monthly payment will likely be higher. Second,
         when you buy a house, you’ll owe stamp duty, insurance, and maintenance fees that will add hundreds per month. If the garage
         door breaks or the toilet needs repairing, that’s coming out of your pocket, not a landlord’s&mdash;and home repairs are ridiculously
         expensive. So even if your mortgage payment is the same £1,000/month as your rental, your real cost will be about 40 to 50
         percent higher&mdash;in this case, more like £1,500/month when you factor everything in.
      </p>
      
      <p class="calibre6">Bottom line: If you don’t have enough money to make a down payment and cover your total monthly costs, you need to set up
         a savings goal and defer buying until you’ve proven that you can hit your goal consistently, month after month.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Next thing to think about: Are the houses you’re looking at within your price range? It’s funny how so many people I know
         want to live only in the grandest possible house. Sure, your parents may live in one of those now, but it probably took them
         thirty or forty years to be able to afford it. Unless you’re already loaded, you need to readjust your expectations and begin
         with a starter house. They’re called that for a reason&mdash;they’re simple houses that require you to make trade-offs but allow
         you to get started. Your first house probably won’t have as many bedrooms as you want. It won’t be in the most amazing location.
         But it will let you get started making consistent monthly payments and building equity.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Finally, will you be able to stay in the house for at least ten years? Buying a house means you’re staying put for a long
         time. Some people say five years, but the longer you stay in your house, the more you save. There are a few reasons for this:
         If you sell through a traditional estate agent, you pay one to two percent in fees. Add in stamp duty and it’s quite a whack.
         Divide that by just a few years, and it hits you a lot harder than if you had held the house for ten or twenty years. There
         are also the costs associated with moving. And depending on how you structure your sale, you may pay a significant amount
         in taxes. The bottom line here: Buy only if you’re planning to live in the same place for ten years or more.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I have to emphasize that buying a house is not just a natural step in getting older. Too many people assume this and then
         get in over their heads. Buying a house changes your lifestyle forever. No matter what, you have to make your monthly payment
         every month&mdash;or you’ll lose your house and watch your credit tank. This affects the kind of job you can take and your level
         of risk tolerance. It means you’ll need to save for a six-month emergency plan in case you lose your job and can’t pay your
         mortgage. In short, you really need to be sure you’re ready for the responsibility of being a home owner.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Of course, there are certainly benefits to buying a house and, like I said, most Americans will purchase one in their lifetime.
         If you can afford it and you’re sure you’ll be staying in the same area for a long time, buying a house can be a great way
         to make a significant purchase, build equity, and create a stable place to raise a family.
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">THE TRUTH: REAL ESTATE IS A POOR INVESTMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Americans’ biggest “investments” are their houses, but real estate is also the place where Americans lose the most money.
         Realtors (and most home owners) are not going to like me after this section, but in truth, real estate is the most overrated
         investment in America. It’s a purchase first&mdash;a very expensive one&mdash;and an investment second.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">As an investment, real estate provides mediocre returns at best. First, there’s the problem of risk. If your house is your
         biggest investment, how diversified is your portfolio? If you pay £2,000 per month to a mortgage, are you investing £6,000
         elsewhere to balance your risk? Of course not. Second, the facts show that real estate offers a very poor return for individual
         investors. Yale economist Robert Shiller found that “from 1890 through 1990, the return on residential real estate was just
         about zero after inflation.”
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I know this sounds crazy, but it’s true. We fool ourselves into thinking we’re making money when we’re simply not. For example,
         if someone buys a house for £250,000 and sells it for £400,000 twenty years later, they think, “Great! I made £150,000!” But
         actually, they’ve forgotten to factor in important costs like stamp duty, maintenance, and the opportunity cost of not having
         that money in the stock market. The truth is that, over time, investing in the stock market has trumped real estate quite
         handily&mdash;even now&mdash;which is why renting isn’t always a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">I’m not saying buying a house is always a bad decision. It’s just that you should think of it as a purchase, rather than as
         an investment. And, just as with any other purchase, you should buy a house and keep it for as long as possible. Do your homework
         and then negotiate. And know your alternatives (like renting).
      </p>
      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">BUYING VS. RENTING: THE SURPRISING NUMBERS</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">I want to show you why renting is actually a smart decision for many people, especially if you live in an expensive area like
         New York or San Francisco. But first, let’s get rid of the idea that renters are “throwing away money” because they’re not
         building equity. Any time you hear clichés like that&mdash;from <em class="calibre2">any</em> area of personal finance&mdash;beware. It’s just not true, and I’ll show you the numbers to prove it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">The total price of buying and owning a house is far greater than the house’s sticker price. Take a look at this research from
         the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (opposite).
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">When you rent, you’re not paying all those other assorted fees, which effectively frees up tons of cash that you would have
         been spending on a mortgage. <em class="calibre2">The key is investing that extra money.</em> If you do nothing with it (or, worse, spend it all), you might as well buy a house and use it as a forced savings account.
         But if you’ve read this far, chance are good that you’ll take whatever extra money you have each month and invest it.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Of course, like buying, renting isn’t best for everyone. It all depends on your individual situation. The easiest way to see
         if you should rent or buy is to use an online calculator. There are several to choose from: MSN Money has one at 
         <a href="http://money.uk.msn.com/mortgages/calculate/rent_buy_calculator.aspx">http://money.uk.msn.com/mortgages/calculate/rent_buy_calculator.aspx</a> and there’s a test you can take to see if your personality is more suited to renting or buying at

      <h2 class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre7">BECOMING A HOME OWNER: TIPS FOR BUYING YOUR NEW HOUSE</strong></h2>
      <p class="p">Like any area of personal finance, there are no secrets to buying a house. But it does involve thinking differently from most
         other people, who make the biggest purchase of their lives without fully understanding the true costs. Although I may be aggressive
         with my asset allocation, I’m conservative when it comes to real estate. That means I urge you to stick by tried-and-true
         rules, like 25 percent down, a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage, and a total monthly payment that represents no more than 30 percent
         of your gross pay. If you can’t do that, wait until you’ve saved more. It’s okay to stretch a little, but <em class="calibre2">don’t</em> stretch beyond what you can actually pay. If you make a poor financial decision up front, you’ll end up struggling&mdash;and it
         can compound and become a bigger problem through the life of your loan. Don’t let this happen, because it will undo all the
         hard work you put into the other areas of your financial life.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">If you make a good financial decision when buying, you’ll be in an excellent position. You’ll know exactly how much you’re
         spending each month on your house, you’ll be in control of your expenses, and you’ll have money to pay your mortgage, invest,
         and take vacations, buy a TV, or whatever else you want to do.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">Here are some of the things you’ll need to do to make a sound decision.</p>
      <p class="boxh"><strong class="calibre5">Myths About Owning a Home</strong></p>
      <div class="btx">
      <p class="p1"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">“PRICES ALWAYS GO UP IN REAL ESTATE” (OR, “THE VALUE OF A HOUSE DOUBLES EVERY TEN YEARS”).</small></strong> Not true. We can see this now in a very obvious way with the recent real estate crash. But most insidiously, net house prices
         haven’t increased when you factor in inflation, taxes, and other homeowner fees. They appear to be higher because the sticker
         price is higher, but you have to dig beneath the surface.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">“YOU CAN USE LEVERAGE TO INCREASE YOUR MONEY.”</small></strong> Home owners will often point to leverage as the key benefit of real estate. In other words, you can put £20,000 down for
         a £100,000 house, and if the house climbs to £120,000, you’ve effectively doubled your money. Unfortunately, leverage can
         also work against you if the price goes down. If your house declines by 10 percent, you don’t just lose 10 percent of your
         equity&mdash;it’s more like 20 percent once you factor in the 6 percent realtor’s fees, the closing costs, new furniture, and other
         expenses.
      </p>
      <p class="di"><strong class="calibre7"><small class="calibre10">“I CAN ALWAYS TRADE DOWN AND USE MY PROPERTY AS MY PENSION.”</small></strong> Be careful. This isn’t nearly as easy as it looks. If you’re going to trade down you’ll still need to live somewhere and
         realistically it’s probably going to be impossible to trade down to a small enough (or cheap enough) home to make enough money
         to keep going for even a couple of years once you reach retirement. By the time you’ve paid your estate agent’s fees, stamp
         duty (on both the property you’re selling and the one you’re buying), lawyer’s fees and removal costs, you might have very
         little to show for it.

      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">1. Check your credit score.</em></strong> The higher your score, the better the interest rate on your mortgage will be. If your credit score is low, it might be a
       better decision to delay buying until you can improve your score. (See <a href="#calibre_link-81">page 17</a> for details on bettering your score.) Good
         credit translates into not only a lower total cost, but lower monthly payments. The table on the next page from

      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">2. Save as much money as possible for a down payment.</em></strong> Traditionally, you had to put 5 to 10 percent down. In recent years, people were allowed to put as little as zero down&mdash;but
         it’s become all too clear that that was a very bad idea. If you can’t save enough to put 25 percent down, you may have to
         pay a higher lending charge (HLC), which serves as insurance against your defaulting on your monthly payments. The HLC can
         cost around 7.5 percent of the amount over 75 percent that you want to borrow, although some lenders only pass the cost onto
         borrowers if you take out a higher loan-to-value mortgage (say 85 percent and above). But the real reason for saving a higher
         deposit is that you’ll be able to qualify for a lower mortgage rate. If you save 25 percent or more, you should be able to
         access the most competitive deals. If you can’t even save 10 percent, how will you afford an expensive mortgage payment, plus
       maintenance and taxes and insurance and furniture and renovations and… you get the idea. Set a savings goal (<a href="#calibre_link-79">page 106</a>) for
         a down payment, and don’t start looking to buy until you reach it.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">3. Calculate the</em> total<em class="calibre2"> amount of buying a new house.</em></strong> Have you ever gone to buy a car or mobile phone, only to learn that it’s way more expensive than advertised? I know I have,
         and most of the time I just bought it anyway because I was already psychologically set on it. But because the numbers are
         so big when purchasing a house, even small surprises will end up costing you a ton of money. For example, if you stumble across
         an unexpected cost for £100 per month, would you really cancel the paperwork for a new home? Of course not. But that minor
         charge would add up to £30,000 over the lifetime of a twenty-five-year loan&mdash;plus the opportunity cost of investing it. Remember
         that the costs associated with completing the deal and moving in are usually between 2 and 5 percent of the house price. So
         on a £200,000 house, that’s £10,000. Keep in mind that ideally the total price shouldn’t be much more than three times your
         gross annual income. (It’s okay to stretch here a little if you don’t have any debt.) And don’t forget to factor in insurance,
         maintenance, and renovations. If all this sounds a little overwhelming, it’s telling you that you need to research all this
         stuff before buying a house. In this particular case, you should ask your parents and other home owners for their surprise

      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">4. Get the most conservative, boring loan possible.</em></strong> I like fixed rate mortgages, and you should fix for the first five years if you’ve never owned property before (the only
         exception is if fixed rates have increased sharply and you know they’re going to come down soon, in which case you might consider
         a mortgage that tracks the Bank of England base rate, but gives you the option to fix without penalty at any time). Get a
         loan that lets you make overpayments.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">5. Watch out for fees.</em></strong> Over the last few years, mortgage arrangement and booking fees have risen dramatically. In the past they could be a few hundred
         pounds, now they can add up to thousands. Don’t get seduced by the interest rate and ignore the fees. The smaller the mortgage,
         the higher the effect of fees on the real cost of the loan. Some lenders price their mortgages with two different rates, depending
         on the fee you’re prepared to pay. Compare different mortgage deals at

      <h1 class="calibre11">How to Tackle Future Large Purchases</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e’ve covered weddings, cars, and houses, but there are plenty of other major expenses that people don’t plan ahead for&mdash;just
         think about having kids! The problem is that, as we’ve seen, if you don’t plan ahead, it ends up costing you much more in
         the end. The good news is that there is a way to anticipate and handle almost any major expense you’ll encounter in life.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">1. Acknowledge that you’re probably not being realistic about how much things will cost&mdash;then force yourself to be.</em></strong> If you’ve read this whole book (and taken even half of my advice), you’re probably better at your finances than 95 percent
         of other people, but you’re still human. Sorry, but your wedding will be more expensive than you planned. Your house will
         have costs you didn’t account for. Having a head-in-the-sand approach, however, is the worst thing you can do. Bite the bullet,
         sit down, and make a realistic plan of how much your big purchases will cost you in the next ten years. Do it on a napkin&mdash;it
         doesn’t have to be perfect! Just spend twenty minutes and see what you come up with.
      </p>
      <p class="spb"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">2. Set up an automatic savings plan.</em></strong> Because almost nobody will take my recommendation to make a budget to forecast major purchases, I suggest just taking a shortcut
         and setting up an automatic savings plan (see <a href="#calibre_link-82">page 133</a>). Assume you’ll spend £20,000 on your wedding, £15,000 on a car, £15,000
         for the first two years of your first-born kid, and however much you’ll need for a typical down payment for a house in your
         city. Then figure out how much you need to save. If you’re twenty-five, and you’re going to buy a car and get married in seven
         years, that’s £35,000 ÷ 84 months = £416 per month. “But Ramit,” you might say in an annoying whine, “that’s more than four
         hundred pounds per month. I can’t afford that!” Okay, can you afford £150? If so, that’s £150 more than you were doing yesterday.
      </p>
      <p class="spb2"><strong class="calibre7"><em class="calibre2">3. You can’t have the best of everything, so use the P word.</em></strong> Priorities are essential. Like I said, it’s human nature to want the best for our wedding day or first house, and we need
         to be realistic about acknowledging that. But we also need to acknowledge that we simply can’t have the best of everything.
         Do you want the filet mignon or an open bar at your wedding? Do you want a house with a backyard or a neighborhood with better
         local schools? If you have the costs down on paper, you’ll know exactly which trade-offs you can make to keep within your
         budget. If you haven’t written anything down, there will appear to be no trade-offs necessary. And that’s how people get into
         staggering amounts of debt.
      </p>
      <p class="calibre6">For the things you decide aren’t that important, beg, borrow, and steal to save money: If you’re getting married, use a public
         park instead of a ballroom, ask your baker friend to make the cake. If you’re buying a car, cut out the sunroof so you can
         get the model you want. And whatever you do, negotiate the hell out of big-ticket purchases. This is where, if you plan ahead,
         time can take the place of money.
      </p>
      <h1 class="calibre11">A Rich Life for You&mdash;and Others</h1>
      <p class="p"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f I’ve been successful, the end of this book is the beginning of a rich future for you. We know that being rich isn’t just
         about money. We know that most people around us have strong opinions about money, yet are clueless with their own. And we
         know that conscious spending can be fun (especially when it’s automated). But now that you know how money really works, there’s
         one other thing: Not enough people know about being rich. It’s not some mythical thing that happens only to Ivy League grads
         and lottery winners. <em class="calibre2">Anyone</em> can be rich&mdash;it’s just a question of what rich means to you. In my definition, I’ve always believed in getting really good
         at something, then passing it on to others. You’re great at managing your finances and goals now. Would you do me a favor
         and pass the word along to your friends to help them focus on their goals, too? A rich life is about more than money. It starts
         by managing your own. And it continues by helping others become rich.
